### Process
1. Load dedup index (URL, title, entity mappings)
2. For each incoming signal:
   - Check exact URL matches
   - Perform fuzzy title matching
   - Verify entity overlap (3+ threshold)
   - Apply source credibility weighting
   - Flag confidence levels
3. Output deduplicated signals
4. Log dedup decisions and statistics

### Expected Dedup Rate
- Conservative estimate: 15-25% duplicate filtering expected
- Based on overlapping scan windows (multiple scans/day)
- Higher filtering expected for breaking news (Quantum announcements, etc.)

## 11. Recommendations

### For Phase 2 (Dedup Processing)
1. Apply strict URL matching (exact match) first
2. Flag fuzzy title matches for human review (A/B testing threshold: 80-85%)
3. Weight source credibility in conflict resolution
4. Temporal precedence for same-content signals
5. Preserve entity lineage for tracking signal evolution

### For Phase 3 (Signal Classification)
1. Updated category distribution suggests Physical AI dominance (47% Tech)
2. Political category rising (geopolitical sensitivity)
3. Spiritual signals emerging as distinct category (not noise)
4. Cross-category signals frequent (multiple secondary categories)

### For Phase 4 (Analysis & Reporting)
1. Quantum computing signals have highest integrity (primary sources)
2. Climate policy signals show strongest geographic variation
3. Demographic signals consistent across multiple sources (high confidence)
4. Economic forecasts show reasonable consensus (2.6-2.8% growth range)
