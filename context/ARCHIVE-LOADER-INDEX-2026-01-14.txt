USAGE RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

For 2026-01-14 Scanning:

1. PRIMARY CONTEXT FILES
   - Use /context/archive-summary-2026-01-14.json for database reference
   - Use /context/dedup-index-2026-01-14.json for deduplication checks

2. DEDUPLICATION PROCESS
   - Check new signals against URL index first (critical)
   - Apply title similarity at 0.85+ threshold
   - Monitor entity overlap with tracked actors
   - Watch for high-frequency tags
   - Review same-category, different-title cases manually

3. PRIORITY SIGNALS
   - Focus on top 5 priority signals (scores 8.4-8.7)
   - Monitor Technological category (30.7% concentration)
   - Track AI/Physical AI/Quantum progress

4. GAP FILLING
   - Expand source network for URL coverage (currently 3.5%)
   - Address underrepresented regions
   - Monitor underrepresented sectors

5. MONITORING
   - Track consolidation recommendations (3 sources)
   - Watch for new high-frequency entities
   - Update tag index with emerging patterns
