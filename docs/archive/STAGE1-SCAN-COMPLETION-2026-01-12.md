## 🔄 Next Steps (Phase 2)

### Option A: Continue to Signal Classification
- Run `@signal-classifier` on 52 new signals
- Assign primary/secondary STEEPS categories
- Generate structured signal format

### Option B: Deduplication First
- Run `@dedup-filter` to check against existing 48 signals
- Remove any conceptual overlaps
- Then proceed to classification

### Option C: Direct to Impact Analysis
- Skip classification (signals already have STEEPS categories)
- Run `@impact-analyzer` for PESTLE assessment
- Proceed to priority ranking

**Recommended**: Option B → Option A → Phase 2 continuation
