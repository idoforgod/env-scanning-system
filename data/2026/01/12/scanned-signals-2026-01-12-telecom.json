      "summary": "Researchers at SUNY Polytechnic Institute and Florida International University claimed terahertz breakthroughs for 6G networks. Built J-band terahertz testbed (220-330 GHz) studying ultra-high frequency signal behavior, finding THz waves exhibit extended near-field region and asymmetrical uplink-downlink behavior. D-band (110-170 GHz) identified as promising 6G frequency. THz technology supports 100 Gbps to Tbps-level data rates (100-1000x faster than 5G). Global 6G market poised for $500M-$1B (2026) to $150B-$300B (2036).",
