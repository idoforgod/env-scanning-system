KEY FINDINGS
============

1. OVERALL RELIABILITY ASSESSMENT
   - The average pSRT score of 49.6 indicates MODERATE RELIABILITY with significant
     variability in signal quality.
   - NO signals achieved A+ grade, indicating that most signals lack optimal
     specificity and/or source quality.
   - 23 signals (50%) scored in D range (50-59), indicating borderline reliability.
   - Only 2 signals (4.3%) achieved C grade (60-69).

2. SCORE COMPONENT ANALYSIS
   - Source Scores: Predominantly strong (many Tier 1/2 sources = 75-100)
   - Signal Scores: WEAK component (average ~35-40), indicating signals lack
     specific dates, numbers, and actors
   - Analysis Scores: STRONG component (most >90), showing good classification
     and evidence quality

3. QUALITY FLAGS
   - VAGUE_SIGNAL: 4 signals lack specific dates/numbers/actors
   - LOW_SOURCE_QUALITY: 2 signals (Tier 4 sources with high significance)

   Flagged signals require verification and additional sourcing.

4. CRITICAL INSIGHT: Low Signal Specificity

   The primary limitation is insufficient specificity (numbers, dates, actors).
   While sources are credible and classification is solid, signals need:
   - More precise dates and timelines
   - Quantified metrics (percentages, values, volumes)
   - Named entities and responsible actors

   This explains the D-grade ceiling despite strong source and analysis scores.

================================================================================
                         IMPROVEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

1. ENHANCE SIGNAL SPECIFICITY
   Current weakness: Many signals lack quantified metrics and specific dates

   Action Items:
   - Require minimum 2-3 specific dates/timelines per signal
   - Mandate quantified metrics (dollar amounts, percentages, numbers)
   - Include minimum 3-5 named entities per signal

   Expected Impact: Could improve average pSRT by 15-20 points

2. SOURCE DIVERSIFICATION
   Current strength: 78% of signals from Tier 1 sources (credible)

   Action Items:
   - Maintain Tier 1/2 source priority
   - For flagged LOW_SOURCE_QUALITY signals, seek corroboration from Tier 1 sources
   - Create minimum source tier thresholds by significance level

   Current Status: Excellent (no changes needed)

3. STRENGTHEN ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK
   Current strength: Analysis scores excellent (avg ~89)

   Action Items:
   - Continue strong classification and evidence evaluation
   - Expand leading indicator clarity requirement
   - Enhance multi-scenario impact analysis

   Current Status: Excellent (no changes needed)

4. CRITICAL REVIEW PROTOCOL
   For signals scoring < 45 (F grade):
   - Re-source or deprioritize
   - Consider deleting unless strategic value high
   - Require substantial additional evidence

5. SIGNAL MATURATION TRACKING
   Implement tracking for:
   - How signals move through D→C→B→A grades as they mature
   - Source tier improvements as signals gain corroboration
   - Specificity improvements with added details

pSRT Calculation Formula:
Overall pSRT = (Source Score × 0.20) + (Signal Score × 0.35) + (Analysis Score × 0.25)

Component Scoring:

1. SOURCE SCORE (0-100, 20% weight):
   Tier 1 (Official/Authoritative): 100
   Tier 2 (Credible): 75
   Tier 3 (News/Secondary): 50
   Tier 4 (Other): 25

2. SIGNAL SCORE (0-100, 35% weight) - Specificity & Freshness:
   - Dates/timelines: 0-30 points
   - Numbers/metrics: 0-30 points
   - Named entities: 0-20 points
   - Freshness (≤5 days old): 20 points

3. ANALYSIS SCORE (0-100, 25% weight) - Classification & Evidence:
   - Clear primary/secondary classification: 0-15 points
   - Evidence quality (indicators, impacts): 0-40 points
   - Confidence & significance: 0-40 points

Grade Scale:
   A+ (90-100): Excellent reliability, highly specific, authoritative sources
   A (80-89):   Very good reliability, specific, strong sources
   B (70-79):   Good reliability, mostly specific, credible sources
   C (60-69):   Adequate reliability, some specificity, mixed sources
   D (50-59):   Marginal reliability, limited specificity, needs verification
   E (40-49):   Poor reliability, vague signals, weak specificity
   F (0-39):    Very poor reliability, unsubstantiated

Flags:
   VAGUE_SIGNAL: No specific dates/numbers/actors (≥2 required)
   LOW_SOURCE_QUALITY: Tier 4 source with significance ≥4

================================================================================
                          NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. Review all 8 F-grade signals for potential removal or re-sourcing
2. Implement enhanced signal template with specificity requirements
3. Establish minimum pSRT thresholds for action (suggest: ≥55 for consideration)
4. Track signal maturation as they gain specificity and confirmation
5. Quarterly re-calculation of pSRT scores as signals develop
6. Consider creating separate scoring for emerging vs. developing vs. mature signals
