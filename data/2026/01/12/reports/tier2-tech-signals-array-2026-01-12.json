    "description": "Nvidia unveiled Alpamayo at CES 2026, an open-source family of AI models that enable autonomous vehicles to reason through complex driving edge cases (like traffic light outages) using chain-of-thought logic. The 10B-parameter vision-language-action model includes 1,700+ hours of real-world driving data and is expected to power Mercedes-Benz autonomous vehicles in Q1 2026, marking the first production deployment of reasoning-capable Level 4 AVs.",
    "weak_signal_rationale": "This represents a fundamental paradigm shift: moving autonomous driving from perception-based pattern-matching to reasoning-based causal understanding. Unlike Tesla's supervised learning approach, Alpamayo can handle unprecedented edge cases. The open-source strategy and Q1 2026 production timeline prove the technology has crossed feasibility threshold, accelerating AV deployment timelines by 2-3 years.",
