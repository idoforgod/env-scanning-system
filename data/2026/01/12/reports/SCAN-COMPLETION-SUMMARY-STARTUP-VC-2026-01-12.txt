================================================================================
KEY THEMES ACROSS SIGNALS
================================================================================

1. EMERGING TECHNOLOGY CATEGORIES
   - Agent-native software (rebuilding enterprise software from first principles)
   - Data infrastructure (data entropy as competitive moat, not model quality)
   - Physical AI/Robotics (hardware + AI convergence hitting inflection point)
   - Defense tech (now mainstream VC category, $7.7B 2025)

2. VC THESIS SHIFTS DETECTED
   - From model-centric to data-centric AI infrastructure
   - From generalist to specialized mega-funds (vertical/mission-based)
   - From "AI hype" to "fundamentals-first" (revenue, efficiency, real advantage)
   - From pure software focus to mixed portfolio (hardware, defense, biotech)

3. MARKET STRUCTURE CHANGES
   - Barbell effect: mega-rounds for winners, survival challenge for others
   - Geographic bifurcation: Tel Aviv, Berlin, Singapore competing with US
   - Fund consolidation: mega-funds dominating, smaller VCs squeezed
   - Category bifurcation: Infrastructure/defense vs traditional SaaS

4. GEOGRAPHIC SHIFTS IN INNOVATION
   - Tel Aviv: 4th global ecosystem, $235B value, hardware/deeptech focus
   - Berlin: Fintech + CleanTech leadership, 1.4B euros EIC funding
   - Singapore: Maintaining Asia-Pacific hub, $12.6B Q1 2025 funding
   - Europe: Independent ecosystem maturation (distinct from US model)

================================================================================
