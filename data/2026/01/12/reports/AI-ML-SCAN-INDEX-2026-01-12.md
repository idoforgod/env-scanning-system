- State laws effective Jan 1, 2026 (CA, NY)
- Anthropic's compliance-first market positioning

### Pattern 4: Geopolitical Fragmentation
Emergence of regional/sovereign AI frameworks.
- K-EXAONE positioned as "sovereign AI" for South Korea
- Government involvement in model development and deployment
- Expected EU, India, Japan responses in coming months
