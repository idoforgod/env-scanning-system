Scientists at UNSW Sydney developed a CRISPR variant that activates genes by removing methyl chemical tags—without cutting DNA. The technique reactivates the fetal globin gene to treat Sickle Cell disease, avoiding the cancer risks associated with DNA-cutting approaches. Settles a decades-long scientific debate about whether methyl groups cause gene silencing or are just byproducts.

**Why This is a Weak Signal:**
- **Safety Paradigm:** Shifts gene therapy from irreversible DNA cuts to reversible epigenetic changes

Critically, lab experiments demonstrated the process is **partially reversible** by restoring iron levels or boosting cellular signaling pathways. Aging appears not to be inevitable at the molecular level.

**Why This is a Weak Signal:**
