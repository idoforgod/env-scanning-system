ASSESSMENT SUMMARY
================================================================================

The exploration scan reveals a space industry at an inflection point:

1. COMMERCIALIZATION: Cost-reduction breakthroughs (3D printing, reusability)
   reaching viability threshold. Market validating decade-long investment thesis.

2. MILITARIZATION: Geopolitical tensions driving space-based defense systems.
   Arms race dynamics emerging in anti-satellite and missile defense domains.

3. CONSOLIDATION: Government and commercial sectors converging around hybrid
   public-private model. Legacy contractors losing market share to startups.

4. SUSTAINABILITY: Orbital population limits approaching. Debris management
   becoming strategic constraint. Regulatory intervention likely 2028-2030.

5. CONVERGENCE: Space-based and terrestrial networks dissolving as separate
   architectural domains. Future = hybrid systems by design.

The next 18 months (2026-2027) will be critical in validating or falsifying
these trends. Starship 3.0, Artemis II, and Terran R represent pivotal
milestones that will either accelerate or constrain projected exponential growth.

OVERALL ASSESSMENT: STRONG WEAK SIGNALS of systemic transformation.
Recommend elevated monitoring and strategic planning priority.
