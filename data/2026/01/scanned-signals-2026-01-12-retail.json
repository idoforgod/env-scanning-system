Consumer spending growth slows to 1.5% (down from 2.5-3% in 2023-2024) amid wage growth of 3.5% barely exceeding inflation. Shopping centers undergo transformation with mixed-use development and B-mall strategic investments. Dynamic pricing regulation expands with NY's algorithmic pricing disclosure requirements. Same-day delivery accelerates with Amazon's 30-minute delivery and Walmart's multi-channel fulfillment. Tariff impacts continue as forward-bought inventory depletes.",
