If we have to choose between the US and\nDenmark\nhere and now, we choose Denmark, Nato and the EU,” Nielsen said, adding that the island’s “goal and desire is peaceful dialogue, with a focus on cooperation”.Trump’s pursuit of the island was also a matter of “international law and our right to our own country”, he said.\nTrump first raised the idea of a US takeover of Greenland, a largely self-governing part of the Danish kingdom, in 2019, during his first term, and again in the weeks before he took office for his second term last January. But he has ramped up his rhetoric significantly this month, saying the US\nwould take it “one way or the other”\n.\nTrump’s most recent threats have prompted a geopolitical crisis, raised significant doubt over the survival of Nato and, for many of the 57,000 Greenlandic people who have found themselves at the centre of it, sleepless nights and anxiety over their safety, identity and futures.\nIn Greenland’s snow-covered capital, Nuuk, the fear is palpable among residents who are faced with having to get on with their day-to-day lives while trying to grapple with potentially existential questions, amplified by a constant stream of news and updates on their phones. Meanwhile, the world’s media has descended on the small city that is geographically closer to New York than it is to Copenhagen, which continues to control Greenland’s foreign and security policy. One shop displayed T-shirts that said: “GREENLAND IS NOT FOR SALE!”\nThe foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland, Lars Løkke Rasmussen and Vivian Motzfeldt, are due to hold a crunch meeting in Washington on Wednesday with the US vice-president, JD Vance, and the US secretary of state,\nMarco Rubio\n.\nNaaja H Nathanielsen, Greenland’s minister for business, mineral resources, energy, justice and gender equality, said on a visit to London on Tuesday that the Greenlandic government did not know what was on the agenda for the White House meeting. Urging the US to act as allies, she said: “For others it might be a piece of land but for us it is home.”\nThe meeting comes as Trump has shocked the EU and\nNato\nby refusing to rule out military force to seize the strategically located and mineral-rich island, which is covered by many of the protections offered by the two organisations because Denmark belongs to both.\nFrederiksen said it had not been easy for Denmark to “stand up to completely unacceptable pressure from our closest ally”. She said something fundamental was at stake, and there was “much evidence the most challenging part lies ahead”.\nThe fact was that “borders cannot be changed by force, and that small countries should not fear large countries”, she said. “That is why we are saying no. We are not looking for any conflict. But our message is clear. Greenland is not for sale.”\nFrederiksen has previously said a US invasion would\nlead to the end of Nato\n, and multiple\nEuropean leaders have pledged\ntheir support for Greenland’s territorial integrity and right to self-determination. Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, on Tuesday said that any US move to take control of Greenland “would be a real unprecedented situation in the history of Nato, and in the history of any defence alliance in the world”.\nGreenland is Europe’s credibility litmus test – it must show Trump that aggression carries a price | Fabian Zuleeg\nRead more\nAfter a meeting of the Danish parliament’s foreign affairs committee on Tuesday, the Danish defence minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, said he and Motzfeldt would meet the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, in Brussels next Monday.\nPoulsen said Denmark planned a larger military presence alongside other Nato countries in Greenland this year, adding that Copenhagen sought “greater attention from Nato in relation to issues regarding Nato’s presence in and around the Arctic”.\nTrump argues the US needs to control Greenland to increase Arctic security in the face of an alleged threat from China and Russia. Rutte said on Tuesday all Nato members agreed that “when it comes to the protection of the Arctic, we have to work together”.\nThe Nato chief declined repeatedly to comment on US demands, saying it was “not up to me to comment on discussions between allies”. He said the alliance was “working on the next steps” and was in “complete agreement on the urgency of the situation”.\nBut Thomas Dans, Trump’s Arctic commissioner, said there could be meaningful US action taken in relation to Greenland in as little as “weeks or months”, telling USA Today that the president wants developments to move “at high speed”.\nAlliance members including France and Germany have floated suggestions including bolstering Nato’s presence in the region or stationing troops on Greenland itself. Diplomats say talks are at a very early stage and there are no concrete plans.\nIn Nuuk, Pele Broberg, the leader of Naleraq, the opposition and the most US-friendly of Greenland’s political parties,\ntold the Guardian the preferable outcome of the Washington talks was to reach a deal with the US. “They want to do a deal the easy way or the hard way: who wants the hard way?” he asked.\nHe also questioned Løkke Rasmussen’s attendance, saying the talks had “nothing to do with Danish foreign politics, and everything to do with the Greenlandic people’s future”.\nGreenland has been moving toward independence since 1979, when it won self-rule from Denmark. The goal is shared by all political parties elected to the island’s parliament, although there are differences over the best timescale.\nBroberg accused Copenhagen of using “Nato, and the Danish ownership of Greenland” to have a say in Greenland’s future. “It shows that they are still not ready to actually let us go,” he said.\nGreenland’s government said on Monday\nit could not “under any circumstances accept” a US takeover and would intensify its efforts to “ensure that the defence of Greenland is carried out within the framework of Nato”.\nIt said it believed Greenland would remain a member of the western defence alliance “for ever” and that “all Nato member states, including the US, have a common interest” in the defence of the vast Arctic island.\nAdditional reporting by Kiran Stacey\nExplore more on these topics\nGreenland\nDenmark\nDonald Trump\nNato\nJD Vance\nMarco Rubio\nEurope\nnews\nShare\nReuse this content",

        "original_content": "This was supposed to be\nthe year that climate tech died\n.\nPresident Donald Trump and the Republican Party have done their best to\ndismantle\nthe Biden administration’s hallmark industrial and climate policies. Even the European Union has begun to\nease off\nits most aggressive goals.\nAnd yet, as the year closes, the receipts provide a different view of climate and clean energy investing in the U.S. and Europe. Instead of tanking, venture bets in the sector remained essentially flat relative to 2024,\naccording\nto CTVC, far from the slide some had expected.\nThat resiliency is due in part to continued threat of climate change. Perhaps a bigger contributing factor is that many climate technologies have become either cheaper or better than the fossil fuel alternatives — or are on the cusp of being so.\nThe incredible cost reductions of solar, wind, and batteries continue to fill climate tech’s sails. Not every new technology will follow the same path. But it does provide evidence that fossil fuels aren’t invincible and ample opportunities to fund companies providing cleaner, cheaper replacements do exist.\nData centers continue to dominate\nLast year, I predicted that 2025 would be\nthe year that climate tech learned to love AI\nand its thirst for electricity, one that has largely borne out. It’s not entirely surprising — for the climate tech world, cheap, clean energy is its cornerstone.\nInterest in data centers has only increased in the last year. And investors TechCrunch surveyed were nearly unanimous in their agreement that data centers will remain at the center of the conversation in 2026.\nTechcrunch event\nJoin the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist\nAdd yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector.\nSan Francisco\n|\nOctober 13-15, 2026\nW\nAITLIST\nNOW\n“They are creating their own financial ecosystem, and there is enough actual momentum in current AI efforts that I don’t see the hyperscalers pulling back in 2026,”\nTom Chi\n, founding partner at\nAt One Ventures\n, told TechCrunch.\n“I’m still hearing about an ever increasing concentration of effort and focus on data centers virtually every single day in meetings, especially with corporates,”\nPo Bronson\n, managing director at\nSOSV\n’s\nIndieBio\n, told TechCrunch.\nIn 2025, data centers were obsessed with securing new sources of power. But\nLisa Coca\n, partner at\nToyota Ventures\n, thinks they’ll adjust their focus for 2026. “The 2026 data center energy conversation is likely to shift from demand to resilience and the need to accelerate plans to decouple from the grid,” she said. Decoupling could solve some challenges that data centers face, namely in resistance from grid operators and the public, who are\nincreasingly worried\nthat the new loads are driving up their electricity prices.\nThere will still be the need for more power, though, and investors saw geothermal, nuclear, solar, and batteries as having benefited from the boom. “Zero-carbon generation is already among the cheapest sources of power, and growing demand for both grid-scale and distributed batteries is accelerating cost reductions faster than expected,” said\nDaniel Goldman\n, managing partner at\nClean Energy Ventures\n.\nInvestors also acknowledged the AI bubble might burst; some voiced skepticism about whether it would drag the energy sector down with it.\n“Could a bubble burst in 2026? Sure,” said\nKyle Teamey\n, managing partner at\nRA Capital Planetary Health\n. But it’s not likely to affect infrastructure plans, he added. “The spending for 2026 is already budgeted. The train has left the station.”\nAndrew Beebe\n, managing director at\nObvious Ventures\n, thinks the data center bubble might burst in 2026 or early 2027, but that no such bubble exists in electricity generation. “We still need a LOT more power, and we’ll use that — no build-out bubble there … yet.”\nOutside of AI and data centers,\nAnil\nAchyuta\n, partner at\nEnergy Impact Partners\n, said reindustrialization will take more of the spotlight this year. “We need to rebuild supply chains for systems that require multiple components and complex flowsheets,” he said, citing robotics, batteries, and power electronics as examples.\nThe continuing quest for power\nThanks to the drumbeat of new data center announcements, energy-related startups have gotten a boost this past year, perhaps none more than those working on nuclear fission. In\nthe\nlast\nfew\nweeks\n, nuclear startups have announced rounds totaling over $1 billion, leading to speculation that many will SPAC or go public through a traditional IPO in 2026.\n“Nuclear everything is in vogue right now,” Teamey said.\nBut it will take a while for nuclear power to make a dent in electricity demand. In the meantime, tech companies and data center developers have been turning to\nsolar\nand batteries as inexpensive, rapidly deployable power sources. Grid-scale batteries, in particular, have been a major beneficiary, seeing\nrecord-setting deployments\nin 2025. As alternative battery chemistries like sodium-ion and zinc come to market, they stand to lower costs and drive further adoption.\n“We’ll see growth in 2026 with new plays on [battery] chemistry and business models.” said\nLeo Banchik\n, director at\nVoyager\n. “One of the key lessons from earlier failures was scaling gigafactories before proving demand or achieving better unit economics than the status quo. The new wave is more disciplined.”\nSeveral investors felt geothermal would step in to help fill the void in the coming years. It helps that investors see enhanced geothermal as a relatively mature technology that’s ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026.\n“Geothermal will be hot on solar’s heels in terms of new generation,” said\nJoshua\nPosamentier\n, managing partner at\nCongruent Ventures\n. “Natural gas assets are growing pretty linearly. There’s not much new capacity in turbine manufacturing coming online, and they’re selling everything they can. Geothermal will go geometric.”\nAnd while AI is helping to drive demand, companies and technologies that think beyond the data center will benefit the most, said\nLaurie Menoud\n, founding partner at\nAt One Ventures\n. “Data centers are one demand driver, not the whole market.”\nWhich startup is most likely to go public in 2026?\nNot everyone was in agreement or would proffer a guess. But among those who did, several said nuclear or geothermal startups were most likely to go public, either via IPO or SPAC.\nThe name mentioned most was Fervo, the enhanced geothermal startup that\nrecently raised a $462 million round\n. The company is widely seen as a leader in the sector and is in the midst of building a 500-megawatt development in Utah that should serve as a template for future power plants. Tapping the public markets would give the company more reserves to tackle additional projects.\nTrends to watch\nBeyond data centers, investors are interested in a range of technologies and sectors, including critical minerals, robotics, and software to manage the electrical grid.\n“We should be paying more attention to grid execution as a category,” said\nAmy Duffuor\n, general partner at\nAzolla Ventures\n. “The quiet winners are companies that make interconnection, planning, and deployment faster software, hardware, and supply-chain solutions that help utilities actually move projects forward.”\nResiliency and adaptation will be big themes in 2026, according to Coca of Toyota Ventures and Posamentier of Congruent Ventures. Achyuta at EIP zeroed in on one potential application: robots that bury electrical transmission lines quicker and more cheaply than humans, mitigating wildfire risks and increasing the grid’s reliability.\nBeebe, at Obvious Ventures, said that EV trucking would also be an area to watch. “One of the biggest pieces of news of 2026 is going to be the release and specs behind the Tesla Semi. The range and pricing of that vehicle will change that industry in ways as powerful as the Model S or 3.”\nAI, of course, is likely to play a role in climate tech’s transformation. “We will see massive innovation where AI meets the physical world in 2026 on both the infrastructure and consumer app layers,” said\nMatt Rogers\n, founder at\nIncite\nand\nMill\n. “Combining AI with smart hardware and physical infrastructure will ensure the transformation of trillion-dollar industries from manufacturing to life sciences to food systems.”\nBut it might also pay to keep an eye on technologies that have already been written off, said Bronson at SOSV. “When investors finally get tired of a sector and come to the conclusion it won’t pan out, that’s when the real breakthroughs finally happen,” he said.\nDive deeper\nBelow are the detailed comments from the investors who replied to TechCrunch’s survey, listed in alphabetical order.

(한 전 대표가) 당을 상대로 가처분하든 뭘 하든 아무 문제가 없을 것”이라며 “오랜 기간 고생하신 당원 여러분께 모든 공을 돌린다. 이제부터 다시 새롭게 미래로 나아가겠다”고 했다. 박민영 대변인도 한 전 대표를 향해 “혹여 가처분 등으로 망신을 자처하는 일은 없길 바란다”며 “그만 정치권을 떠나 자중하며 살라”고 했다.\n김해정 기자\nsea@hani.co.kr",

The focus is already shifting away from building ever-larger language models and toward the harder work of making AI usable. In practice, that involves deploying smaller models where they fit, embedding intelligence into physical devices, and designing systems that integrate cleanly into human workflows.\nThe experts TechCrunch spoke to see 2026 as a year of transition, one that evolves from brute-force scaling to researching new architectures, from flashy demos to targeted deployments, and from agents that promise autonomy to ones that actually augment how people work.\nThe party isn’t over, but the industry is starting to sober up.\nScaling laws won’t cut it\nImage Credits:\nAmazon\nIn 2012, Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton’s\nImageNet paper\nshowed how AI systems could “learn” to recognize objects in pictures by looking at millions of examples. The approach was computationally expensive, but made possible with GPUs. The result? A decade of hardcore AI research as scientists worked to invent new architectures for different tasks.\nThat culminated around 2020 when OpenAI launched GPT-3, which showed how simply making the model 100 times bigger unlocks abilities like coding and reasoning without requiring explicit training. This marked the transition into what Kian Katanforoosh, CEO and founder of AI agent platform Workera, calls the “age of scaling”: a period defined by the belief that more compute, more data, and larger transformer models would inevitably drive the next major breakthroughs in AI.\nToday, many researchers think the AI industry is beginning to exhaust the limits of scaling laws and will once again transition into an age of research.\nYann LeCun, Meta’s\nformer chief AI scientist\n, has long argued against the overreliance on scaling, and stressed the need to develop better architectures. And Sutskever said in a recent\ninterview\nthat current models are plateauing and pretraining results have flattened, indicating a need for new ideas.\nTechcrunch event\nJoin the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist\nAdd yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector.\nSan Francisco\n|\nOctober 13-15, 2026\nW\nAITLIST\nNOW\n“I think most likely in the next five years, we are going to find a better architecture that is a significant improvement on transformers,” Katanforoosh said. “And if we don’t, we can’t expect much improvement on the models.”\nSometimes less is more\nLarge language models are great at generalizing knowledge, but many experts say the next wave of enterprise AI adoption will be driven by smaller, more agile language models that can be fine-tuned for domain-specific solutions.\n“Fine-tuned SLMs will be the big trend and become a staple used by mature AI enterprises in 2026, as the cost and performance advantages will drive usage over out-of-the-box LLMs,” Andy Markus, AT&T’s chief data officer, told TechCrunch. “We’ve already seen businesses increasingly rely on SLMs because, if fine-tuned properly, they match the larger, generalized models in accuracy for enterprise business applications, and are superb in terms of cost and speed.”\nWe’ve seen this argument before from French open-weight AI startup Mistral: It argues its small\nmodels actually perform better\nthan larger models on several benchmarks after fine-tuning.\n“The efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and adaptability of SLMs make them ideal for tailored applications where precision is paramount,” said Jon Knisley, an AI strategist at ABBYY, an Austin-based enterprise AI company.\nWhile Markus thinks SLMs will be key in the agentic era, Knisley says the nature of small models means they’re better for deployment on local devices, “a trend accelerated by advancements in edge computing.”\nLearning through experience\nImage Credits:\nWorld Labs/TechCrunch\nHumans don’t just learn through language; we learn by experiencing how the world works. But LLMs don’t really understand the world; they just predict the next word or idea. That’s why many researchers believe the next big leap will come from world models: AI systems that learn how things move and interact in 3D spaces so they can make predictions and take actions.\nSigns that 2026 will be a big year for world models are multiplying. LeCun left Meta to start his own world model lab and is reportedly\nseeking a $5 billion valuation\n. Google’s DeepMind has been plugging away at Genie and in August launched its latest model that builds real-time interactive general-purpose world models. Alongside demos by startups like\nDecart\nand\nOdyssey\n,\nFei-Fei Li’s World Labs\nhas launched its first commercial world model, Marble. Newcomers like General Intuition in October scored a\n$134 million seed round\nto teach agents spatial reasoning, and video generation startup Runway in December released its\nfirst world model, GWM-1\n.\nWhile researchers see long-term potential in robotics and autonomy, the near-term impact is likely to be seen first in video games. PitchBook predicts the market for world models in gaming could grow from $1.2 billion between 2022 and 2025 to $276 billion by 2030, driven by the tech’s ability to generate interactive worlds and more lifelike non-player characters.\nPim de Witte, founder of General Intuition, told TechCrunch virtual environments may not only reshape gaming, but also become critical testing grounds for the next generation of foundation models.\nAgentic nation\nAgents failed to live up to the hype in 2025, but a big reason for that is because it’s hard to connect them to the systems where work actually happens. Without a way to access tools and context, most agents were trapped in pilot workflows.\nAnthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP), a “USB-C for AI” that lets AI agents talk to the external tools like databases, search engines, and APIs, proved the missing connective tissue and is quickly becoming the standard. OpenAI and Microsoft have publicly embraced MCP, and Anthropic recently donated it to the\nLinux Foundation’s new Agentic AI Foundation\n, which aims to help standardize open source agentic tools. Google also has begun standing up its own\nmanaged MCP servers\nto connect AI agents to its products and services.\nWith MCP reducing the friction of connecting agents to real systems, 2026 is likely to be the year agentic workflows finally move from demos into day-to-day practice.\nRajeev Dham, a partner at Sapphire Ventures, says these advancements will lead to agent-first solutions taking on “system-of-record roles” across industries.\n“As voice agents handle more end-to-end tasks such as intake and customer communication, they’ll also begin to form the underlying core systems,” Dham said. “We’ll see this in a variety of sectors like home services, proptech, and healthcare, as well as horizontal functions such as sales, IT, and support.”\nAugmentation, not automation\nImage Credits:\nPhoto by Igor Omilaev on Unsplash\nWhile more agentic workflows might raise worries that layoffs may follow, Katanforoosh of Workera isn’t so sure that’s the message: “2026 will be the year of the humans,” he said.\nIn 2024, every AI company predicted they would automate jobs out of needing humans. But the tech isn’t there yet, and in an unstable economy, that’s not really a popular rhetoric. Katanforoosh says next year, we’ll realize that “AI has not worked as autonomously as we thought,” and the conversation will focus more on how AI is being used to augment human workflows, rather than replace them.\n“And I think a lot of companies are going to start hiring,” he added, noting that he expects there to be new roles in AI governance, transparency, safety, and data management. “I’m pretty bullish on unemployment averaging under 4% next year.”\n“People want to be above the API, not below it, and I think 2026 is an important year for this,” de Witte added.\nGetting physical\nImage Credits:\nDavid Paul Morris/Bloomberg / Getty Images\nAdvancements in technologies like small models, world models, and edge computing will enable more physical applications of machine learning, experts say.\n“Physical AI will hit the mainstream in 2026 as new categories of AI-powered devices, including robotics, AVs, drones, and wearables start to enter the market,” Vikram Taneja, head of AT&T Ventures, told TechCrunch.\nWhile autonomous vehicles and robotics are obvious use cases for physical AI that will no doubt continue to grow in 2026, the training and deployment required is still expensive. Wearables, on the other hand, provide a less expensive wedge with consumer buy-in. Smart glasses like the\nRay-Ban Meta\nare starting to ship assistants that can answer questions about what you’re looking at, and new form factors like\nAI-powered health rings\nand\nsmartwatches\nare normalizing always-on, on-body inference.\n“Connectivity providers will work to optimize their network infrastructure to support this new wave of devices, and those with flexibility in how they can offer connectivity will be best positioned,” Taneja said.\nTopics\nAI\n,\nAI agents\n,\nmcp\n,\nphysical ai\n,\nsmall language models\n,\nworld models\nRebecca Bellan\nSenior Reporter\nRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where ",

The 55-year-old had not cried since he was a boy, but as he dismantled the family home and prepared to flee the village where his whole life had played out, he was overwhelmed by grief.\nWhile Eshaq’s children loaded mattresses, a fridge, sacks of flour and suitcases of clothes into a truck, masked soldiers escorted a teenage Israeli shepherd down the main village road, where he posed for photos on his donkey, flashing a V sign.\nThe ethnic cleansing of Ras ‘Ein al ‘Auja was underway, and the men and boys who made life untenable for Palestinians here had come to celebrate.\nView image in fullscreen\nThe Israeli settler shepherd, escorted by a white truck with Israeli soldiers.\nPhotograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The Guardian\nEshaq’s home, a community of about 135 families, was the largest and most established of the Bedouin villages dotted on hillsides in this part of the Jordan valley.\nBy the start of this year, it was also the only one left. A campaign of intensifying settler violence – arson, mass theft, beatings, intimidation and destruction of property – forced out village after village until their last remaining neighbours, in nearby Mu’arrajat, fled in July.\nIsraeli settlers now have full control of more than 250 sq km (100 sq miles) of land in this part of the occupied\nWest Bank\n, where a decade ago only Bedouin herds grazed, said Dror Etkes, founder of settlement monitoring group Kerem Navot.\nPalestinians have been forced out of this area, which the international community has earmarked as part of their future state.\n“We were living here peacefully, but they made us into an enemy. The settlers brought the violence,” Eshaq said. “I haven’t cried my whole life, but this morning I was crying. This is a terrible day for us.”\nHe grew up gazing across the Jordan river at mountains rising sharply toward white hilltop towns, and splashing in the wadi where his children and grandchildren later played. At night the clear desert skies are crowded with stars.\nThe bedouin families who live there are descendants of refugees forced out of the Naqab, or Negev, in what is now Israel, in 1948. Poor, isolated and with little political influence even within Palestinian society, they are relatively easy targets for settlers.\nThe project to push them out of their homes began before the war in Gaza but gathered speed and strength as political and media attention focused elsewhere.\n“When the war started settler leadership understood they had an unprecedented opportunity to step up ethnic cleansing for the area,” Sarit Michaeli, international director of rights group B’Tselem.\n“The midterm goal is to remove Palestinians from all the open land in the West Bank, and they are doing this with the full participation of the Israeli government. The settler maps make clear that ultimately they want to empty the land of Palestinians.”\nThe campaign of forced displacement here is run from small outposts where teenage boys and a few adults manage flocks of sheep, goats and camels.\nTaking land by building homes and communities on it is slow and expensive. Taking control of large swathes of dry hills by bringing in animals and using them to intimidate, isolate and bar Palestinians is much more efficient.\nWest Bank map\nThe foot soldiers in this war of Israeli expansion are young men, including minors sent to outposts by the state under a programme for at-risk youth.\n“In recent years, the Jewish shepherds have continued to conquer more and more territory,” read one message in a settler WhatsApp group celebrating the forced displacement of a village last year.\n“With all due respect to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], the critical and decisive work of Jewish settlement and the expulsion of the enemy is done by those 15- to 16-year old boys, the ‘Hilltop Youth’.”\nBut if the tools are unsophisticated, the project is anything but. The boys in jeans and slogan T-shirts are part of a state-funded, state-backed project, deploying violence with near total impunity.\nSettlers attack Palestinians using all terrain vehicles and other equipment handed out at public ceremonies by politicians including the far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, himself a settler.\nSecurity forces in the occupied West Bank have resources and time to cull hundreds of crocodiles on a\nrogue farm\n, but not to protect Palestinians.\nIn Ras ‘Ein al ‘Auja, security forces regularly arrest Israeli peace activists and Palestinians, but either ignore settler violence in the area, or support it.\nLast year when a court\nordered\nthe army to coordinate the return of Palestinians driven out of neighbouring Mu’arrajat, the soldiers only stayed a few hours. When they left settlers descended, driving residents out again.\nView image in fullscreen\nPalestinians prepare to leave their home in the Jordan valley.\nPhotograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The Guardian\nIn the two years since October 2023, Israeli soldiers and settlers have killed over 1,000 Palestinians across the occupied West Bank, one in five of them children. No one has been tried or convicted for any of these deaths.\nLast year, settlers beat an American citizen to death, prompting US senators to warn there was\nno accountability\nfor Palestinian lives, and shot a prominent activist on camera.\nThe Israeli military recorded a 25% increase in settler violence last year, Haaretz reported, much of it attributed to larger and better organised groups getting support from politicians and well-known activists.\nTipping point\nIn the new year, violence reached a tipping point for some families in Ras ‘Ein al ‘Auja, after settlers cut several houses off by ploughing up a dirt track and established a makeshift outpost inside the village.\nThey roamed between houses at night severing electricity cables, emptying water tanks and pushing into rooms filled with sleeping women and children.\nLast Thursday, 26 families, more than 120 people, decided the risk of staying outweighed the pain and cost of leaving. Most lived on the edge of the village and their departure left Eshaq’s family effectively on the frontline.\nLooping video of people loading their belongings on to a truck\n“This week we haven’t eaten and haven’t slept,” he said. It only took a couple of days before he also concluded staying was too dangerous. The children at least were relieved, after the terror of the settler home invasions\n“They want to go right now, straight away,” said Rawan, 24, holding nine-month old Yacoub, as her four-year-old son Mousa played nearby.\nNeighbour Mohammed Reshad was packing up as well after a night raid by settlers who stole clothes and mattresses. “They took things from me and my two sisters,” said his nine-year old granddaughter Jana.\nThe truck cost 1,800 shekels (£425) to hire, a small fortune here, and they are still debating where to go. “Is there anyone who will protect me from the settlers? If there is, I will stay,” he said.\nEach family that packs up leaves those who stay even more vulnerable. Na’ef Ja’alin, a 50-year-old father of 10, is still in his home out of desperation, not hope.\n“The ones who have left have family who can give them a plot of land. Me and my brothers have no place to go,” he said. “I have no money, and land is very expensive.”\nMainstream support\nView image in fullscreen\nViolence has reached a tipping point for many Palestinian families in Ras ‘Ein al ‘Auja.\nPhotograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The Guardian\nThe project to displace Palestinians is being carried out by violent extremists backed by far-right cabinet ministers. But annexation of this area is a long-standing, mainstream project in Israel, backed by politicians across party lines.\nYigal Allon, then a cabinet minister from the secular Labor party, laid out an initial plan soon after Israel seized the West Bank in 1967. He wanted Israel to hold on to a strip of land along the Jordan valley to serve as a security buffer.\nThe CIA described the plan as inflammatory and impractical but noted that the government was already putting some elements in place. “Israel unrealistically feels that the Allon plan is a workable solution to the problems of the occupied territories and has implemented some of its features,” a now declassified\nmemo\nwarned.\nThe plan was never officially adopted but has persisted in Israeli political imagination, helped perhaps by the fact that two Israeli roads roughly delineate Allon’s land grab plans.\nThe strip of territory he wanted for Israel – and which includes Ras ‘Ein al ‘Auja – now lies between highway 90 near the Jordanian border and the “Allon Road” that twists and turns along the mountain ridges down the centre of the West Bank.\nOn official maps this highway is labelled with a jumble of route numbers – 458, 508, and 578 – but all Israelis know it as the Allon Road.\nThe hills that slope down to the river Jordan are sparsely populated, semi-desert land, too dry for agriculture but suitable for grazing. Settler herding outposts have proved a particularly efficient instrument for mass dispossession here.\nLast May, settler leader Elisha Yered celebrated the destruction of another village here as a template for the wider West Bank.\n“This is what redemption looks like!” he posted on social media after the people of Mughayyir al-Deir fled. “God willing, one day we will force you [Palestinians] to the places you belong, in Iraq and ",

What we know on day 1,421\nThe Estonian government has\nbanned 261 Russians who fought in Ukraine\nfrom entering Estonia. “This is only the beginning,” said Markus Tsahkna, Estonia’s foreign minister. “We call on other countries to do the same.” Estonia, which borders Russia, has\ncalled for a Europe-wide visa ban on Russian veterans of the\nUkraine\nwar\n, and has gained support from Baltic and Nordic countries. Its interior ministry estimates as many as 1.5 million Russians have taken part in the invasion, about half of them having served on the frontline.\nEstonia’s interior minister, Igor Taro, said the threat posed was “not theoretical”, adding that\nthe Russians had “combat experience and military training, and may often have a criminal background”\n. The interior ministry said those who had committed atrocities in Ukraine had “no place in the free world”. The move was praised the Ukrainian foreign minister, Andrij Sybiga, who called entry bans a “necessary security measure” and “a clear signal that impunity will not be tolerated”.\nUkraine said its forces struck a\ndrone manufacturing plant in the western Rostov region of Russia\nwhere the governor reported a local state of emergency there after two “enterprises” were hit. Various reports identified the target as the\nAtlant Aero plant at Taganrog\nmaking Russia’s Molniya strike and surveillance drones as well as parts for Orion drones. Video footage and photographs showed buildings well ablaze.\n‘They want to break us’: Russian energy grid strikes give freezing Kyiv some of its darkest days\nRead more\nTwo Greek-owned\noil tankers were hit in the Black Sea on Tuesday\n, one of which was scheduled to load Kazakh oil on Russia’s coast, officials said. The Maltese-flagged Matilda and Liberian-flagged Delta Harmony did not sustain major damage and there were no injuries, Greece’s maritime ministry told Agence France-Presse. The Matilda was headed to load Kazakh oil at the\nCaspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) terminal\nnear Russia’s Black Sea port of Novorossiysk when it was attacked, Kazakh state energy firm Kazmunaygas said. Ukraine has previously targeted the shared CPC terminal as it seeks to deprive Russia of oil revenue.\nRussia struck cities across Ukraine overnight into Tuesday in one of its biggest attacks of the new year so far,\nkilling at least four people and knocking out heat and power\n,\nexposing millions to dangerous winter cold\n.\n1:32\nPeople feel like the 'Russians are trying to freeze them': Guardian reporter in Kyiv – video\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s president, said\nRussia\nhad\nlaunched nearly 300 drones, 18 ballistic missiles, and seven cruise missiles\nduring the attacks on eight Ukrainian regions. Emergency power cuts were introduced in the capital, Kyiv, and also in the Chernihiv, Odesa, Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk regions, the energy ministry said. Kyiv residents have endured days of interrupted power and heating supplies after the last big Russian strike last week.\nExplore more on these topics\nUkraine\nRussia-Ukraine war at a glance\nRussia\nEurope\nexplainers\nShare\nReuse this content",

In the first half of 2025 alone, “the Monsters” line of toys, which includes Labubus, generated 4.8bn yuan (£511m) in sales for the Hong Kong-listed company. In August, Pop Mart’s chief executive, Wang Ning,\nsaid the company\nwas on track to reach 20bn yuan in revenues in 2025.\nAccording to an investigation by\nChina\nLabor Watch (CLW), a New York-based NGO, one of Pop Mart’s suppliers for Labubus has engaged in exploitative workplace practices. They include workers being forced to sign blank contracts, 16- and 17-year-olds being employed without the special protections for young workers required by Chinese law, inadequate health and safety training and other labour rights violations at the factory in south-east China’s Jiangxi province.\nCLW sent investigators to Shunjia Toys in Xinfeng county in Jiangxi, a factory that employs more than 4,500 people, over three months in 2025. The researchers interviewed more than 50 employees, including three under the age of 18. All of the workers were working exclusively on Labubus.\nThe researchers found that the factory employed workers aged 16 to 18, which is legal under Chinese law, but only with special protections such as prohibitions on dangerous or strenuous work. The 16- to 18-year-old workers at Shunjia had been assigned to standard assembly line positions with no difference in workload or production targets to adult workers.\n“The underage workers also generally did not understand the nature of the contracts they signed, and had no clear concept of their legal status when asked,” CLW’s report said.\nThe investigation also found that workers routinely signed blank labour contracts. CLW said workers were told to fill in their personal details on employment contracts, while details of the working conditions, such as the contract’s term, the job content, the salary and social insurance details were left “blank and unexplained”.\n“Workers were given no more than five minutes to complete the process and were told explicitly not to read or fill in other sections,” CLW said.\nReflecting the soaring demand of the toys, workers said they were given unrealistic production targets, with a team of 25-30 workers being required to assemble at least 4,000 Labubus a day. Chinese labour law limits monthly overtime to 36 hours, but CLW found that workers often worked more than 100 additional hours each month.\nShunjia Toys has an official production capacity of 12m toys per year, with plans announced in late 2025 to expand to 33m.\nThat represents a small share of the overall production of Labubus, which Pop Mart said last year was about 30m units per month. The company works with a range of local manufacturing partners in China and south-east Asia, with recent additions in Mexico as demand soars.\nHowever, CLW’s interviews suggested that Shunjia was already producing far more than 12m units annually, with two teams alone estimated to produce more than 24m units per year. “This gap between planned capacity and actual output is not uncommon in China’s manufacturing sector,” said Li Qiang, the executive director of CLW. “When market demand rises rapidly, production often expands well beyond planned levels, with the resulting pressure borne directly by workers.”\nA spokesperson for Pop Mart said: “At Pop Mart, we take the welfare and safety of workers at our [original equipment manufacturers] factories very seriously. We conduct regular, standardised audits of our OEM supply chain partners, including annual independent third-party audits carried out by internationally recognised professional audit firms.\n“We appreciate the information brought to our attention and are currently investigating the matter. Going forward, Pop Mart will continue to strengthen supply chain audit and oversight mechanisms. Should the findings be substantiated, we will firmly require the relevant partners to implement comprehensive corrective actions in accordance with local laws and regulations.”\nShunjia Toys could not be reached for comment\n.\nThe conditions described in the Shunjia Toys factory are not uncommon in China’s manufacturing sector, where workers work long hours for low pay, with scant enforcement of the labour protections that are officially enshrined in Chinese law.\nThe soaring demand for Labubus has also generated a large\nblack market for fakes, known as Lafufus\n, which are often done by informal workers in home factories with zero oversight about working conditions.\nThe findings reflect the challenges faced by Chinese companies which are aggressively pushing into international markets but are increasingly expected to abide by higher standards for their workers.\nLi said: “At present, existing supply-chain oversight mechanisms do not appear sufficient to identify and prevent these labour issues in a timely and effective manner. If Pop Mart is serious about reducing labor risks in the Labubu supply chain, it should establish accessible grievance and communication mechanisms for workers (such as an independent and effective worker hotline), improve transparency around actual factory working conditions, and disclose its supply chain structure, including outsourced production, to enable meaningful oversight.”\nAdditional research by Jason Tzu Kuan Lu\nExplore more on these topics\nChina\nAsia Pacific\nChild labour\nWorkers' rights\nnews\nShare\nReuse this content",

The Iranian government has accused the US of seeking to manufacture a pretext for military intervention, as US president\nDonald Trump has pledged that “help is on its way”.\nHere is what we know so far:\nDonald Trump has said the US “will take very strong action” against Iran if the regime starts to execute people\nas part of their crackdown on the spiralling protests. Trump told CBS News: “When they start killing thousands of people – and now you’re telling me about hanging. We’ll see how that’s going to work out for them.”\nErfan Soltani, a 26-year-old man arrested in connection with protests in the city of Karaj is scheduled to be executed on Wednesday\n, according to the Iranian Kurdish rights group, Hengaw. Authorities had told the family that the death sentence was final, Hengaw reported, citing a source close to the family.\nThe US president has urged the protests to continue, and again suggested US military action could follow\n. “Iranian Patriots, keep protesting – take over your institutions!!! … help is on its way,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Tuesday, a day after the White House press secretary said airstrikes were among “many, many options” the US president was considering.\nMore than 2,000 people have been killed in the protests\n– more than 90% of whom were demonstrators – and over 16,700 people have been arrested, the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said.\nDoctors in Iran have described overwhelmed hospitals and emergency wings\noverflowing with protesters who had been shot. One ophthalmologist in Tehran has\ndocumented more than 400 eye injuries\nfrom gunshots in a single hospital.\nThe US state department has said US citizens should leave\nIran\nnow\nand “if safe to do so, consider departing Iran by land to Armenia or Türkiye”. The\nUS virtual embassy for Iran\nsays citizens should “plan alternative means of communication” due to “continued internet outages” and “have a plan for departing that does not rely on US government help”.\nDonald Trump announced that he was cancelling meetings with Iranian officials “until the senseless killing” stops, signalling a possible breakdown in de-escalation efforts\n. Trump is expected to receive a briefing on Tuesday night on the scale of casualties in Iran.\nElon Musk’s SpaceX is offering people in Iran free internet through Starlink’s satellite service\n,\naccording to Bloomberg News\n, as the internet blackout in the country surpassed the five-day mark.\nTrump’s envoy Steve Witkoff met in secret with Reza Pahlavi, the exiled former Iranian crown prince, last weekend, Axios reported.\nA senior US official told the outlet the pair discussed the protests. In previous messages that have been blocked by the Iranian government internet shutdown, he has said that he is ready to lead a transition.\nIn response to Trump’s social media post that “help is on the way,” Iran’s UN ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani said the US president was inciting violence, threatening the country’s sovereignty\nand security and seeking to destabilise the government. “The United States and the Israeli regime bear direct and undeniable legal responsibility for the resulting loss of innocent civilian lives, particularly among the youth,” he wrote in a letter to the UN security council.\nRussia on Tuesday condemned “subversive external interference” in Iran’s internal politics\n, saying any repeat of last year’s US strikes would have “disastrous consequences” for the Middle East and international security.\nBritain, France, Germany and Italy all summoned Iranian ambassadors in protest over the crackdown\n. “The rising number of casualties in Iran is horrifying,” European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen posted on X. Underscoring international uncertainty over what comes next in Iran, which has been one of the dominant powers across the Middle East for decades, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he believed the government would fall.\nExplore more on these topics\nIran\nUS foreign policy\nMiddle East and north Africa\nnews\nShare\nReuse this content",

The US president probably has few to no workable military options to help them.\nPhotograph: AP\nAnalysis\nWhy Trump’s options are limited when it comes to using force against Iran\nDan Sabbagh\nDefence and security editor\nAs US president tells protesters ‘help is on the way’, any military action would be unlikely to succeed\nIran crisis live – latest updates\nDonald Trump may not be\nunafraid to use military force\nagainst Iran, according to the White House, but the reality is the US president has few to no options that could obviously help that country’s protest movement, never mind the fact that the history of US intervention in the region has hardly been a success.\nEmboldened by the seizure of the erstwhile Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, after\nan operation that took months of planning\n, Trump talked up military intervention against the Iranian regime with no military pre-positioning having taken place. In fact, there has been a drawdown in the last few months, reducing military options further.\nThe US has had no aircraft carriers deployed in the Middle East since October, after two years of near continuous deployment following the Hamas attack on Israel, having moved out the USS Gerald R Ford to the Caribbean in the summer and the USS Nimitz to a port on the US west coast in the autumn.\nIt means any air or missile strikes against regime targets, and perhaps at the Iranian leader,\nAyatollah Ali Khamenei\n, would probably have to come from or involve US and allied airbases in the Middle East. An alternative would be similar to June’s long range B-2 bombing mission against the underground Iranian nuclear site of Fordow, although that sort of attack against an urban site would appear to be dangerous overkill.\nThe US would also have to ask permission to use bases in countries such as Qatar, Bahrain, Iraq, the UAE, Oman and Saudi Arabia (perhaps even the UK’s Akrotiri base in Cyprus) – and protect them and their host countries against retaliation. Even if such assets were not used by the US, Iranian leaders have threatened to strike US bases and ships if the country is attacked.\nAlthough Iran’s military capabilities were badly degraded in the 12-day summer war with Israel, and its air defence systems easily overwhelmed, Tehran has retained a limited missile capability. Key launch sites remain buried in the mountains, and it has been rebuilding. It is estimated that\nIran has 2,000 heavy ballistic missiles\n, capable, if launched in numbers, of evading US and Israeli air defences.\nGraphic\nA more salient question is: what would the US bomb? It would be possible to identify military and civilian sites used by the Iranian regime, but both the protests and the increasingly bloody regime crackdown are taking place across the country. Targeting is not always accurate, sites can be misidentified and civilian casualties in urban locations would be an evident risk. And it is not obvious this would be effective on the ground.\nIt would also not be difficult for the Iranian regime to try to use any US attacks as a rallying point for what is left of its support, given the long history of US meddling dating back to the 1953 CIA coup. And, however unpopular it may be with ordinary people protesting, the ruling regime does not appear to be brittle or weak, having already survived Israel’s sustained attack in June.\n“There is a clearly a cohesive government and military and security service in Iran,” said Roxane Farmanfarmaian, a senior associate at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank. “The government is showing it doesn’t have any red lines: it is going to secure its borders and streets, and the extraordinary number of body bags reveals its determination to do so.”\nThe US could consider a direct attack on Khamenei. Trying to kill the Iranian leader would be easier militarily than a Maduro-style seizure operation, which would be considerably more complex than in Venezuela because Tehran lies hundreds of miles from the country’s borders. However, killing the leader of another country would be astonishingly escalatory, raise a host of legal concerns, and invite a sustained military response.\nNor would it necessarily lead to regime change. During the 12-day war, Khamenei appears to have evaded Israeli detection: the country’s defence minister, Israel Katz, defence minister said afterwards that “if he had been in our sights, we would have taken him out”. The Iranian leader had also lined up\nthree senior clerics on a shortlist\nto replace him if he was killed, in an effort to secure a rapid transition.\nOther experts, such as Farmanfarmaian, argue that the most likely outcome would be a takeover led by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards. But either way, the Iranian regime remained intact after Israel killed as many as 30 military and security leaders in June. A handful of US demonstration strikes would be unlikely to change that, while US allies, Congress and Trump himself would almost certainly not want a lengthy campaign. Already, the president himself has ruled out “boots on the ground”.\nAgainst such an uncertain backdrop, it is not surprising alternatives have been canvassed. The most notable is a targeted cyber-attack, raising the question of what would be intended. After the seizure of Maduro, Trump claimed that the US had turned off the power in Caracas to help facilitate his capture, but this would only be useful in Iran in conjunction with a military operation.\nCiaran Martin, a former head of the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre, argues that “it is hard to see what could work” and that “disrupting civilian or even government services” such as electricity would probably affect civilians more. A theoretical possibility would be for the US to try restore the internet, largely shut down since last Thursday, though Martin added it would be “hard to intervene via cyber” to do so.\nA simpler possibility would be to try and “flood the place with Starlink” – Elon Musk’s satellite internet service – by overcoming Iranian jamming, providing the service for free. But, Martin said, that was “not really a cyber-operation” and sharing more information about repression may not stop the killing in the streets. What can be achieved by US military intervention may not match up to Trump’s promise that\n“help is on its way”\n.\nExplore more on these topics\nIran\nUS foreign policy\nDonald Trump\nMiddle East and north Africa\nAyatollah Ali Khamenei\nanalysis\nShare\nReuse this content",

Soltani had lost contact with loved ones on 8 January amid mass protests and the regime’s internet shutdown, the group said.\nIran is the world’s most prolific executioner after China, according to monitors. Last year, it hanged at least 1,500 people, Norway-based Iran Human Rights group said.\nErfan Soltani, 26, is reportedly facing imminent execution in Iran.\nPhotograph: HENGAW ORGANIZATION FOR HUMAN RIGHTS",

EPA연합뉴스\n[서울경제]\n다카이치 사나에 일본 총리가 중의원 해산을 단행할 경우 조기 총선이 내달 8일 전후로 실시되는 방안이 논의되는 것으로 알려졌다. 조기 총선 관측 확산 속에 다카이치 총리의 적극 재정 정책에 대한 기대가 증시에 반영되며 일본 증시는 또 사상 최고가를 경신했다.\n요미우리신문은 다카이치 총리가 정기국회 소집일인 오는 23일 곧바로 중의원(하원)을 해산하는 방안을 검토 중이라고 14일 보도했다. 요미우리는 “2월 8일 조기 총선거의 투개표가 이뤄지면 이달 23일 중의원 해산 후 16일만으로 전후 최단기간이 된다”며 “예산안 국회 심의에 미칠 영향을 억제하려는 취지”라고 설명했다. 다만 준비 상황에 따라 투·개표일이 다소 늦춰질 가능성도 남은 것으로 알려진다.\n조기 총선이 현실화되면 2026회계연도(2026년 4월~2027년 3월) 정부 예산안의 3월말 이전 국회 통과는 어려워질 전망이다. 이 경우 잠정 예산 편성 등으로 대응해야 한다.\n다카이치 총리는 아직 최종 결정을 공식화하지 않은 상태다. 그러나 여야 정치권은 이미 준비 태세에 들어간 모습이다. 아사히신문에 따르면 기하라 미노루 관방장관은 전날 선거 사무를 총괄하는 스즈키 슌이치 자민당 간사장 등과 만나 선거 판세 분석을 논의한 것으로 알려졌다.\n조기 총선 전망은 일본 증시를 강세장으로 이끌고 있다. 이날 일본 대표 주가지수인 닛케이225 평균주가(닛케이지수)는 전 거래일 대비 1.48% 오른 5만 4341엔으로 마감했다. 사상 처음 5만 4000엔을 돌파한 것이다. 장중 오후 12시 30분께는 5만 4487엔까지 상승하기도 했다.\n시장에서는 조기 총선 이후 자민당의 승리로 적극적인 재정 기조를 내세우는 다카이치 내각이 탄력을 받을 수 있다는 기대가 주가를 끌어올린 것으로 보고 있다. 닛케이는 “중의원 해산 가능성이 부각되면서 총선에서 여당이 의석을 늘릴 경우 경제 정책이 추진되기 쉬워질 것이라는 전망이 일본 주식 매수를 뒷받침했다”고 분석했다.\n과거 조기 총선 국면에서 주가가 상승했던 경험도 투자 심리를 자극하고 있다. 2000년 이후 중의원 해산은 9차례 있었는데 이 가운데 7번이 해산일부터 투·개표일까지 닛케이지수는 상승곡선을 그렸다.\n정국 변화는 환율과 채권시장에도 영향을 미쳤다. 엔화는 약세를 보였고 장기 금리는 상승하는 흐름을 이어갔다. 이날 오전 도쿄 외환시장에서 1달러 당 엔화 환율은 159.4엔대를 기록했다. 일본 정부가 매수 개입에 나섰던 2024년 7월 이후 약 1년 6개월 만에 엔화 가치가 가장 낮은 수준으로 떨어진 것이다.\n일본 국채 10년물 수익률은 2.185%까지 상승해 1999년 2월 이후 약 27년 만에 최고치를 기록했다. 교도통신은 “다카이치 총리가 적극 재정 정책 속도를 높이면 국채 발행으로 재정 악화가 심해질 것이라는 우려가 강해져 금리가 오르고 있다”고 해석했다.",

Accounting for negative economic effects, the revenue raised by the tariffs falls to $1.7 trillion over the next decade. The Trump tariffs threaten to\noffset much\nof the economic benefits of the new tax cuts, while falling short of paying for them.\nThe US Supreme Court will soon decide whether the president’s emergency powers under IEEPA include the power to impose tariffs.\nHistorical evidence\nand recent studies show that\ntariffs are taxes\nthat\nraise prices\nand reduce available quantities of goods and services for US businesses and consumers, resulting in lower income, reduced employment, and lower economic output.\nAverage Tariff Rates\nThe new tariffs will significantly raise the tariff rates the US applies to most imports. According to the World Bank, the weighted average applied tariff was 1.5 percent in 2022. We estimate that under the tariffs currently imposed and scheduled, it rises by 14.3 percentage points to 15.8 percent.\nHowever, if the IEEPA tariffs are permanently enjoined, it will rise by 5.3 percentage points to 6.8 percent. The weighted average applied tariff rate measures the rate imposed on different products from different countries, and it differs from averages measured by actual tariff revenues as a share of total goods imports.\nWe estimate the average\neffective\ntariff rate by estimating how tariff revenues as a share of total goods imports will change. After incorporating behavioral responses, including our estimated drop in imports of about $659 billion (20 percent), we estimate the average effective tariff rate will rise to 11.2 percent—the highest rate since 1943. However, if the IEEPA tariffs are permanently enjoined, we estimate the average effective tariff rate will rise to 4.6 percent with behavioral adjustments—the highest rate since 1973.\nTariff Revenue Collections\nIn calendar year 2025, customs duties have raised $264 billion for the federal government, including both new tariffs and pre-existing ones, such as those President Trump imposed in his first term. The total revenue raised by tariffs will be less than the direct collections, because tariffs mechanically reduce the bases of income and payroll taxes.\nEconomic Effects\nOn May 28, a panel of judges at the US International Court of Trade unanimously ruled that the IEEPA tariffs were illegal, a decision that was upheld by the US Court of Appeals. Our estimates below separate the effects of the IEEPA tariffs from the Section 232 tariffs, which were not affected by the rulings. See the Appendix for a detailed explanation of the modeled provisions.\nWe estimate that before accounting for any foreign retaliation, the Section 232 tariffs will reduce long-run US GDP by 0.2 percent. The IEEPA tariffs, including the scheduled “reciprocal” tariffs, will reduce long-run GDP by an additional 0.4 percent if they are upheld by the courts and remain in place.\nAs of September 1, threatened and imposed retaliatory tariffs affect $223 billion of US exports based on 2024 US import values; if fully imposed, we estimate they will reduce long-run US GDP by 0.2 percent. Combined, the US-imposed tariffs and the threatened and imposed retaliatory tariffs reduce long-run US GDP by 0.7 percent. Totals may not sum due to rounding.\nTable 1.

We model the imposed tariffs together, accounting for interactions between the different rounds of tariffs and timing of implementation. Additionally, we account for income and\npayroll tax\nA payroll tax is a tax paid on the wages and salaries of employees to finance social insurance programs like Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment insurance. Payroll taxes are social insurance taxes that comprise 24.8 percent of combined federal, state, and local government revenue, the second largest source of that combined tax revenue.\noffsets, as tariffs\nmechanically reduce those tax bases\n. For this reason, the total tax revenue raised on net will be less than the tariff revenue reported by Treasury. Revenue is even lower on a dynamic basis, a reflection of the negative effect tariffs have on US economic output, reducing incomes and resulting tax revenues. Revenue would fall more when factoring in foreign retaliation, as retaliation would cause US output and incomes to shrink further.\nAltogether, we estimate the tariffs will raise $2.2 trillion on a conventional basis and $1.7 trillion on a dynamic basis from 2025 through 2034.\nOn a conventional basis, before incorporating negative economic effects, we estimate that the Section 232 tariffs will increase US federal tax revenue by $608 billion over the next decade. The IEEPA tariffs will raise an additional $1.5 trillion in revenue over the next decade. The IEEPA tariffs raise less in 2025 than in later years because they will not be in effect for the full calendar year.\nOn a dynamic basis, incorporating the negative effects of the US-imposed tariffs on the US economy, we estimate that the Section 232 tariffs will raise $453 billion over the next decade, about $155 billion less than the conventional estimate. The IEEPA tariffs will raise an additional $1.2 trillion over the next decade, about $318 billion less than the conventional estimate. Incorporating the negative effects of imposed retaliatory tariffs as of September 1, 2025, further reduces 10-year revenue by $146 billion.\nTable 2.

SNS나 온라인 쇼핑을 줄이는 게 답일까?\nA. 연구진은 특정 인터넷 활동을 일괄적으로 금지하거나 제한하는 방식이 반드시 해결책은 아니라고 본다. 스트레스를 받아 SNS나 쇼핑을 찾는 경우도 있어, 개인별 사용 패턴을 이해하고 균형을 맞추는 접근이 필요하다는 설명이다.",

        "original_content": "MIT Technology Review\n’s What’s Next series looks across industries, trends, and technologies to give you a first look at the future. You can read the rest of them\nhere\n.\nIn an industry in constant flux, sticking your neck out to predict what’s coming next may seem reckless. (AI bubble? What AI bubble?) But for the last few years we’ve done just that—and we’re doing it again.\nHow did we do last time? We picked\nfive hot AI trends to look out for in 2025\n, including what we called\ngenerative virtual playgrounds\n, a.k.a world models (check: From Google DeepMind’s\nGenie 3\nto World Labs’s\nMarble\n, tech that can generate realistic virtual environments on the fly keeps getting better and better); so-called\nreasoning models\n(check: Need we say more? Reasoning models have fast become the new paradigm for best-in-class problem solving);\na boom in AI for science\n(check: OpenAI is now following Google DeepMind by setting up a\ndedicated team to focus on\njust that);\nAI companies that are cozier with national security\n(check: OpenAI reversed position on the use of its technology for warfare to sign a\ndeal with the defense-tech startup Anduril to help it take down battlefield drones\n); and\nlegitimate competition for Nvidia\n(check, kind of: China is going all in on developing advanced AI chips, but Nvidia’s dominance still looks unassailable—for now at least).\nSo what’s coming in 2026? Here are our big bets for the next 12 months.\nMore Silicon Valley products will be built on Chinese LLMs\nThe last year shaped up as a big one for Chinese open-source models. In January,\nDeepSeek released R1\n, its open-source reasoning model, and shocked the world with what a relatively small firm in China could do with limited resources. By the end of the year, “DeepSeek moment” had become a phrase frequently tossed around by AI entrepreneurs, observers, and builders—an aspirational benchmark of sorts.\nIt was the first time many people realized they could get a taste of top-tier AI performance without going through OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google.\nOpen-weight models like R1 allow anyone to download a model and run it on their own hardware. They are also more customizable, letting teams tweak models through techniques like distillation and pruning. This stands in stark contrast to the “closed” models released by major American firms, where core capabilities remain proprietary and access is often expensive.\nAs a result, Chinese models have become an easy choice. Reports by\nCNBC\nand\nBloomberg\nsuggest that startups in the US have increasingly recognized and embraced what they can offer.\nOne popular group of models is Qwen, created by Alibaba, the company behind China’s largest e-commerce platform, Taobao. Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct alone has 8.85 million downloads, making it one of the most widely used pretrained LLMs. The Qwen family spans a wide range of model sizes alongside specialized versions tuned for math, coding, vision, and instruction-following, a breadth that has helped it become an open-source powerhouse.\nOther Chinese AI firms that were previously unsure about committing to open source are following DeepSeek’s playbook. Standouts include Zhipu’s GLM and Moonshot’s Kimi. The competition has also pushed American firms to open up, at least in part. In August, OpenAI released its first open-source model. In November, the Allen Institute for AI, a Seattle-based nonprofit, released its latest open-source model, Olmo 3.\nEven amid growing US-China antagonism, Chinese AI firms’ near-unanimous embrace of open source has earned them goodwill in the global AI community and a long-term trust advantage. In 2026, expect more Silicon Valley apps to quietly ship on top of Chinese open models, and look for the lag between Chinese releases and the Western frontier to keep shrinking—from months to weeks, and sometimes less.\n—\nCaiwei Chen\nThe US will face another year of regulatory tug-of-war\nT​​he battle over regulating artificial intelligence is heading for a showdown. On December 11, President Donald Trump signed an executive order aiming to neuter state AI laws, a move meant to handcuff states from keeping the growing industry in check. In 2026, expect more political warfare. The White House and states will spar over who gets to govern the booming technology, while AI companies wage a fierce\nlobbying campaign\nto crush regulations, armed with the narrative that a patchwork of state laws will smother innovation and hobble the US in the AI arms race against China.\nUnder Trump’s executive order, states may fear being sued or starved federal funding if they clash with his vision for light-touch regulation. Big Democratic states like California—which just enacted the nation’s first\nfrontier AI law\nrequiring companies to publish safety testing for their AI models—will take the fight to court, arguing that only Congress can override state laws. But states that can’t afford to lose federal funding, or fear getting in Trump’s crosshairs, might fold. Still, expect to see more state lawmaking on hot-button issues, especially where Trump’s order gives states a green light to legislate. With chatbots accused of triggering\nteen suicides\nand data centers sucking up\nmore and more energy\n, states will face mounting public pressure to push for guardrails.\nIn place of state laws, Trump promises to work with Congress to establish a federal AI law. Don’t count on it. Congress failed to pass a\nmoratorium\non state legislation twice in 2025, and we aren’t holding out hope that it will deliver its own bill this year.\nAI companies like OpenAI and\nMeta\nwill continue to deploy powerful\nsuper-PACs\nto support political candidates who back their agenda and\ntarget\nthose who stand in their way. On the other side, super-PACs\nsupporting AI regulation\nwill build their own war chests to counter. Watch them duke it out at next year’s midterm elections.\nThe further AI advances, the more people will fight to steer its course, and 2026 will be another year of regulatory tug-of-war—with no end in sight.\n—\nMichelle Kim\nChatbots will change the way we shop\nImagine a world in which you have a personal shopper at your disposal 24-7—an expert who can instantly recommend a gift for even the trickiest-to-buy-for friend or relative, or trawl the web to draw up a list of the best bookcases available within your tight budget. Better yet, they can analyze a kitchen appliance’s strengths and weaknesses, compare it with its seemingly identical competition, and find you the best deal. Then once you’re happy with their suggestion, they’ll take care of the purchasing and delivery details too.\nBut this ultra-knowledgeable shopper isn’t a clued-up human at all—it’s a chatbot. This is no distant prediction, either. Salesforce recently\nsaid\nit anticipates that AI will drive $263 billion in online purchases this holiday season. That’s some 21% of all orders. And experts are betting on AI-enhanced shopping becoming even bigger business within the next few years. By 2030, between $3 trillion and $5 trillion annually will be made from agentic commerce, according to\nresearch\nfrom the consulting firm McKinsey.\nUnsurprisingly, AI companies are already heavily invested in making purchasing through their platforms as frictionless as possible. Google’s\nGemini app\ncan now tap into the company’s powerful\nShopping Graph\ndata set of products and sellers, and can even use its agentic technology to call stores on your behalf. Meanwhile, back in November, OpenAI announced a\nChatGPT shopping feature\ncapable of rapidly compiling buyer’s guides, and the company has struck deals with Walmart, Target, and Etsy to allow shoppers to buy products directly within chatbot interactions.\nExpect plenty more of these kinds of deals to be struck within the next year as consumer time spent chatting with AI keeps on rising, and web traffic from search engines and social media continues to plummet.\n—\nRhiannon Williams\nAn LLM will make an important new discovery\nI’m going to hedge here, right out of the gate. It’s no secret that large language models spit out a lot of nonsense. Unless it’s with monkeys-and-typewriters luck, LLMs won’t discover anything by themselves. But LLMs do still have the potential to extend the bounds of human knowledge.\nWe got a glimpse of how this could work in May, when Google DeepMind revealed AlphaEvolve, a system that used the firm’s Gemini LLM to\ncome up with new algorithms for solving unsolved problems\n. The breakthrough was to combine Gemini with an evolutionary algorithm that checked its suggestions, picked the best ones, and fed them back into the LLM to make them even better.\nGoogle DeepMind used AlphaEvolve to come up with more efficient ways to manage power consumption by data centers and Google’s TPU chips. Those discoveries are significant but not game-changing. Yet. Researchers at Google DeepMind are now pushing their approach to see how far it will go.\nAnd others have been quick to follow their lead. A week after AlphaEvolve came out, Asankhaya Sharma, an AI engineer in Singapore, shared OpenEvolve, an open-source version of Google DeepMind’s tool. In September, the Japanese firm Sakana AI released a version of the software called SinkaEvolve. And in November, a team of US and Chinese researchers revealed AlphaResearch, which they claim improves on one of AlphaEvolve’s already better-than-human math solutions.\nThere are alternative approaches too. For example, researchers at the University of Colorado Denver are\ntrying to make LLMs more inventive\nby tweaking the way so-called reasoning models work. They have drawn on what cognitive scientists know about creative thinking in humans to push reasoning models toward solutions that are more outside the box than their typical safe-bet suggestions.\nHundreds of companies are spending billions of dollars looking for ways to get AI to\ncrack unsolved math problems\n,\nspeed up computers\n, and come up with\nnew drugs\nand\nmaterials\n.

        "original_content": "The year that just ended saw numerous records broken on climate and clean energy.\nIt was the second-hottest year on record at Earth’s surface,\nbehind only 2024\n. The high temperatures were shocking for a year with a La Niña event. La Niñas draw cold water up to the surface of the Pacific Ocean, and hence are relatively cool years at Earth’s surface, while El Niño events have the opposite effect. 2025 was by far the hottest year with a La Niña event.\nFor perspective, 1998 was a record-shattering hot year at the time because it experienced the strongest El Niño event on record, but it was more than half a degree Celsius colder than 2025. Global warming has made 1998 look so unremarkable that La Niña years today dwarf the temperature record set during the biggest El Niño event in modern history.\nIn fact, the past dozen years have been the 12 warmest on record, especially the past three, which were all more than 1.4°C hotter than preindustrial temperatures.\n1986-2025 global average surface temperature categorized by years with a significant La Niña cooling influence (blue), El Niño warming influence (red), neutral conditions (black), and those with a cooling influence from a recent large volcanic eruption (orange triangles). (Data:\nNASA\n. Graphic: Dana Nuccitelli)\nThe vast majority of the heat trapped by climate pollution is absorbed by Earth’s oceans, which have warmed even more than the planet’s surface. Nearly every year sets a new record for ocean and global heat content, and 2025 was no exception. A\nnew study\nestimated that the oceans absorbed energy equivalent to detonating nearly 10 Hiroshima atomic bombs in the oceans every second of every minute in 2025.\nDespite\nlearning this year that climate change is accelerating\n, the U.S. government took numerous regulatory and legislative steps that will increase the country’s climate-warming pollution. And U.S. emissions reversed their long-term downward trend to instead increase in 2025.\nBut despite the bleak domestic picture, the rest of the world made significant climate and clean energy progress. China continued to emerge as a clean technology leader, positioning itself to overtake the U.S. as\nthe next global economic superpower\n.\nWhile these trends seem likely to continue in 2026, the U.S. Congress has the opportunity to pass major climate and clean energy legislation in the coming year – unless the Trump administration derails it.\nChina and the U.S. moved in opposite directions in 2025\nGlobal carbon pollution increased by about 1% in 2025, according to independent researchers at\nCarbon Monitor\nand the\nGlobal Carbon Project\n. It increased by about 2% in the U.S. as a result of a combination of factors, including a cold winter (requiring more fossil-fueled heating) and high natural gas prices that led to a rare\nincrease in the country’s coal consumption\n.\nThe Trump administration and Congress together also took actions in 2025 to\nundo all federal climate regulations\nand\ngut many of the clean energy tax credits\npassed in the Inflation Reduction Act three years prior. And despite having\ndeclared an energy emergency on his first day in office\n, Trump’s administration blocked many\nwind\nand\nsolar\nenergy projects across the country.\nThe administration also undermined federal climate science research, for example, by\nmoving to dismantle a world-leading climate and research center\n,\ndeleting climate change from federal websites\n, and considering\nputting a handful of fringe contrarians in charge\nof the country’s most comprehensive climate science report that normally requires contributions from hundreds of America’s best scientists.\nBut while the U.S. is the second-highest climate polluting country, responsible for around 12% of global emissions, China is responsible for about one-third of the world’s climate-warming pollution due to its much larger population. And China took climate change and the clean energy transition much more seriously than the U.S. in 2025.\nIn fact, China’s climate pollution has\nplateaued over the past year and a half\n. More than half the country’s new vehicle sales last year were electric, compared to less than one-tenth in the United States. Chinese automakers also exported 1.7 million EVs to regions like Southeast Asia, allowing the electric share of new car sales in many developing countries to\nsurpass that of the U.S.\nAnd\nChina built more solar and wind power in 2025\n(well over 300 gigawatts of capacity – equivalent to about 300 nuclear power plants) than the U.S. has in its entire history. China built so much new clean energy that it exceeded its power demand growth. As a result, the country\nburned less fossil fuel for electricity\nthis year than in 2024. And\nChina exported over $200 billion in clean energy technologies\nto other countries in 2025, increasing their adoption around the world.\nCongress could pass major clean energy legislation in 2026\nDespite falling behind China on climate leadership and clean energy deployment, the coming year presents one opportunity for the U.S. to regain some of that lost ground. Although the current session of Congress has been\nhistorically unproductive\n, a significant amount of its focus has been on energy policy. And many of the most headline-inducing recent efforts from lawmakers have centered around the prospect of\npermitting reform\n.\nNumerous energy systems experts have identified slow permitting processes – especially for electrical transmission lines, which\ncan take close to two decades to permit\n– as a key\nbottleneck slowing the clean energy transition\n. Transmission lines are the highways of the power grid, allowing electrons to travel long distances from power plants to population centers. The U.S. has built\nfew new transmission lines\nover the past several decades, but that wasn’t a problem because power demand also barely grew during that period.\nThat situation is changing. Power demand is suddenly rising fast, thanks largely to the rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence data centers. New power plants,\nmost of which are solar farms with battery storage facilities\n, are working to meet that rising demand but are limited by an old and inadequate power grid. In other words, more electrons are trying to enter the transmission highway from new solar farms and exit to reach new data centers, but a lack of new transmission lines is causing traffic jams.\nAmerican lawmakers have been engaging in bipartisan negotiations to speed up energy infrastructure permitting processes for\nover three years\n. They narrowly failed to pass such a bill in late 2024, called the Energy Permitting Reform Act.\nAn analysis\nby energy systems experts at the nonpartisan think tank RMI estimated that the transmission permitting reform provisions in that bill could have allowed enough clean energy to connect to the U.S. grid to reduce the country’s climate pollution by around 6.5 billion tons between 2030 and 2050. That’s roughly equivalent to recovering the estimated emissions reductions lost over the next decade\nthrough the Republican rollback of the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy tax credits\n.\nAlthough there is bipartisan recognition of the need to build energy infrastructure faster in order to meet growing power demand, there remains one big obstacle standing in the way of these negotiations: President Donald Trump.\nDemocratic lawmakers have warned that they will not vote for a bill that will only expedite fossil fuel projects. They have been working to craft legislation that will prevent the executive branch from selectively obstructing permits for certain types of energy infrastructure, but after the Trump administration once again halted work on all under-construction offshore wind projects,\nDemocrats declared that they will stop permitting reform negotiations\nuntil those obstructions are lifted.\nRelatedly,\na recent national survey\nconducted by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication (the publisher of this site) and the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication found that 59% of registered voters would prefer to vote for a candidate who supports action on global warming.\nThe clean energy transition will continue in 2026\nAll signs indicate that clean technologies will continue to\ndominate new energy deployments\nin 2026, both in the U.S. and globally. Despite the Trump administration’s best efforts, clean energy sources deployed predominantly on private lands (where the federal government usually can’t block their permits) accounted for over 90% of the country’s new power capacity additions in 2025. That trend is expected to continue due to simple economics (solar panels and batteries have become relatively cheap) and supply chain constraints (they’re much faster to deploy than gas turbines, whose production additionally faces years-long\nbacklogs\n).\nNew power generation capacity installed in the U.S. in January-September 2025 from solar (yellow), battery storage (green), wind (blue), and natural gas (gray). (Data:\nFERC\n, Graphic: Dana Nuccitelli)\nThe\nInternational Energy Agency also forecasts\nthat global electric vehicle adoption will continue to accelerate, even as it lags in the U.S. In addition to being cheaper to fuel and maintain,\nEVs in China are also already cheaper to buy\nthan fossil-fueled cars.\nAnd as the Trump administration places its chips on the continued burning of fossil fuels, China is betting on dominating the technologies of the clean energy transition. In what will be yet\nanother of the hottest years on record\n, with most governments around the world rapidly adopting affordable low-carbon solutions in an effort to curb climate change, it seems likely that China’s clean technology dominance will help\nits economy continue to rapidly gain on America’s\nin 2026.\nmore like this\nHome electricity bills are skyrocketing.

        "original_content": "DTM is the abbreviated form of the Demographic Transition Model. Scientists designed this model to better classify population trends over time as they relate to the number of births and deaths within a society or country. The DTM model looks at various external forces as well as social, economic, and political forces at play to classify populations within one of five stages. Countries progress through stages as populations change over time. Often, observing a particular country’s stage within the Demographic Transition Model can better help understand the economic and social stability of the country. Higher stage countries generally have more stable population growth and thus a better social and economic platform to sustain and support the population.\nWhat Is Stage 5 DTM?\nIn a country classified as Stage 5 in the DTM model, the population is usually high, but there are signs of a declining population. Usually, the birth rate will fall quickly in these countries and cannot keep up with the number of deaths. In a Stage 5 country example, the death rate may be as high as 9 per 1,000 people, but the birth rate is only 7 per 1,000 people. In this example, the number of new births cannot keep up with the number of aging and dying people.\nIn some rare cases, a negative population growth rate does not determine stage 5 DTM. In many countries in Europe, the birth rate is not enough to keep up with the death rate. However, the population continues to increase year after year. In this case, demographic changes usually result from immigration to a particular country, which is not accommodated in the DTM model. In these countries where immigration is artificially increasing the population, it will take two to three generations before the actual decline in population as a result of low birth rates is shown in population demographics.\nStage 5 population decline due to low birth rate is often related to better employment opportunities that may limit a woman’s childbearing years or better education that can be connected to smaller family size. Other times, lower birth rates can result from a country enforcing child-producing limitations to help manage a growing population. A perfect example of a country exercising this control over the people in China’s One-Child Policy used to prevent the exponential growth of the population.\nWhat Are Stage 5 DTM Countries?\nMany countries have come to the point where their birth rate cannot keep up with the number of deaths. However, their population is inflated by many adults moving to the country. Because the Demographic Transition Model does not account for migration or immigration changes, these countries cannot be included in the Stage 5 DTM statistics. Primarily, countries that have been included with Stage 5 DTM numbers are Southern and Eastern European countries. Examples include Germany, Greece, Estonia, Croatia, Ukraine, and Portugal.",

That’s what this trade show, held every January, does best: it turns prototypes into performances that double as technological predictions. While much of what appears here won’t ever emerge in the real world in a meaningful way, the ideas often do. And at this year’s show, one theme is hard to miss: artificial intelligence is on the move.\nPhysical AI—the use of automated machines that lift, drive, carry and operate in the same spaces humans do—is everywhere at CES, and the people making it have seemed eager to puncture its mythology. For years, the public-facing story of robotics has been viral athleticism: robot marathons, kickboxing videos. Now even the people who built those humanoids are treating them as a distraction. “We were doing ‘YouTube-video parkour’ 10 years ago,” said Robert Playter, CEO of robotics company Boston Dynamics, at a CES panel on AI in the physical world. “The hard stuff is useful work.” In other words: less spectacle, more operation in fields such as mining, construction and logistics, where the work is repetitive and expensive enough to justify the high costs of automation.\nThis step toward pragmatism confronts technology companies with a different barrier: trust. In the simpler times of 2022, when ChatGPT was novel, and AI as we know it lived mainly in chat windows, a hallucination was an annoyance. In a driverless car, it’s a different story. “Hallucination in motion can be disastrous,” said Jyoti Shah of data processing company ADP at a panel on AI in the physical world.\nOn supporting science journalism\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by\nsubscribing\n. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\nMikell Taylor, director of robotics strategy at General Motors, recounted hearing that a Zoox robotaxi recently stopped at a Las Vegas crosswalk and wouldn’t budge, leaving pedestrians confused and guessing. While not catastrophic, the anecdote suggested the urgency of the matter. Physical AI doesn’t just need better sensors; it needs to be legible, with cues easy enough for humans to read. Trust requires robots to be “transparent in their thinking and transparent in their motions,” said Carolina Parada of Google DeepMind, “so people know what to expect.”\nThe need for ever better real-time intelligence highlights a less glamorous theme of this year’s CES: computing power. On the hardware side, chip manufacturers characterized an industry that has been running up against physical limitations. Shankar Krishnamoorthy of electronic design automation company Synopsys said the traditional pace of chip development can’t keep up with what modern models demand. “Customers demand monster chips,” he said, “so we must accelerate innovation cycles by several [times].”\nThen there’s the bill. AI that’s running everywhere, all the time will require massive infrastructure that still doesn’t exist. The scale and speed of today’s AI build-out is already driving up energy consumption and costs, and no amount of chip efficiency can compensate. It’s a constraint that nobody at CES came here to trumpet yet one that low-key governs everything else.\nBy the end of the day, plenty of the AI talk at CES has felt like a familiar story. “I think innovation is happening—it’s just being overhyped,” one conference attendee told me. “In a lot of ways, it echoes the IoT [Internet of Things] wave from 2010.” That is to say, some of the hype is real, and only time will tell what sticks. The question at CES this year is whether physical AI becomes another overused label—or whether it becomes a part of our everyday lives. If it does, that robot at Mandalay Bay will eventually have to do more than just wave.\nIt’s Time to Stand Up for Science\nIf you enjoyed this article, I’d like to ask for your support.\nScientific American\nhas served as an advocate for science and industry for 180 years, and right now may be the most critical moment in that two-century history.\nI’ve been a\nScientific American\nsubscriber since I was 12 years old, and it helped shape the way I look at the world.\nSciAm\nalways educates and delights me, and inspires a sense of awe for our vast, beautiful universe.

It is most optimistic (relative to consensus) about the US because of tax cuts, easier financial conditions, and reduced drag from tariffs.\nIn China, our economists expect robust growth in manufacturing but continued weakness in parts of the domestic economy.\nDespite longer-term challenges and competition from China, the euro area economy is forecast to increase 1.3% next year, owing to fiscal stimulus in Germany and strong growth in Spain.\nOur economists expect core inflation to moderate and policy rates to decline in developed markets in 2026.\nThe global economy is forecast to generate “sturdy” growth in 2026, according to\nGoldman Sachs Research\n. In fact, our economists’ projections for most major countries are at or above consensus estimates.\nWhat is the global economic outlook for 2026?\nGlobal GDP is projected by Goldman Sachs Research to increase 2.8% in 2026 (versus the consensus forecast of 2.5%). US\neconomic growth\nis expected to accelerate to 2.6%, while China’s GDP expands 4.8% as strong exports outweigh sluggish domestic demand. Despite longer-term challenges, our economists predict the euro area economy will increase 1.3%, owing to fiscal stimulus in Germany and strong growth in Spain.\n“As has typically been the case since the pandemic, we are most optimistic (relative to consensus) in the US,” writes Jan Hatzius, chief economist and head of Goldman Sachs Research, in the team’s report titled “Macro Outlook 2026: Sturdy Growth, Stagnant Jobs, Stable Prices.”\nWhat is the forecast for US GDP growth in 2026?\nThe US is expected to substantially outperform consensus estimates because of tax cuts, easier financial conditions, and a reduced drag on the economy from tariffs. As a result of tax cuts, for example, consumers will receive around an extra $100 billion (0.4% of annual disposable income) in tax refunds in the first half of next year.\nThe impulse from these forces is expected to be front-loaded in the first half of 2026, and the rebound from the US government shutdown will also provide a boost. “We expect especially strong GDP growth in the first half of next year,” Hatzius writes.\nHowever, while global GDP is rising, it hasn’t resulted in stronger performance from the labor market. Job growth across all major developed-market economies has now fallen well below the rates prevailing in 2019, just prior to the pandemic.\nAlthough it doesn’t provide the full explanation, the job-market weakness mirrors the sharp downturn in immigration and, in turn, labor force growth, Hatzius writes. The disconnect in employment is most pronounced in the US, where job growth may well have been negative over the summer.\nThe impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on jobs and productivity, meanwhile, has so far mainly been confined to the technology sector, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Our economists expect that the largest productivity benefits from AI are still a few years off.\nThe outlook for China’s economy in 2026\nThe narrative for China’s economy is much more mixed. China’s ability to produce increasingly higher quality goods at lower prices remains unmatched, Hatzius writes. The world’s second-largest economy has demonstrated that it has the capability to deter high tariffs on its exports, as seen in recent trade negotiations with the US.\n“All this suggests that the Chinese manufacturing sector should continue to grow robustly,” Hatzius writes.\nAt the same time, large parts of China’s domestic economy remain weak. While the largest drag on GDP growth from the property downturn has probably already taken place (property sales are down 60% and property starts are down 80% from the peak), our economists estimate that the property sector will produce a 1.5 percentage point drag on GDP growth next year.\n“The combination of a strong manufacturing sector and weak domestic demand is pushing China’s current account surplus ever higher,” Hatzius writes.\nOur economists expect its current account surplus to increase to almost 1% of global GDP over the next 3-5 years, the biggest surplus of any country in recorded history. “This is likely to weigh heavily on growth in economies that compete intensively with China such as the euro area, and particularly Germany,” Hatzius adds.\nWhat is the forecast for the euro area’s economy in 2026?\nIncreased competition from China reinforces the structural weaknesses of the euro area economy, including demographic decline, overregulation, and high energy costs, according to Goldman Sachs Research.\nDespite these challenges, the euro area should grow at a “decent” 1.3% pace in 2026, Hatzius writes. GDP growth in Germany is expected to benefit from the sharp increase in federal government spending that is underway. And our economists expect growth in Southern Europe to remain solid, especially in Spain where real consumer spending has continued to grow at around 3% and the economy’s diversification into higher value-added services continues apace.\nInflation is forecast to moderate in 2026\nCore inflation in developed markets is expected to fall to levels that are broadly consistent with policy targets in 2026.\nIn the US, the main reason why core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation has remained elevated in 2025 is because of tariff pass-through. Excluding tariffs, our economists estimate that inflation has continued to fall and now stands at 2.3%. And although tariff pass-through will likely rise modestly further (assuming tariffs stay around their current levels), the impact on year-on-year inflation will diminish sharply in the second half of 2026 because of favorable so-called base effects.\nAn important factor weighing on inflation in the US and UK is the notable recent slowdown in wage growth in both economies. In the US, nominal wages are now growing below the 4% “sustainable” rate that our economists estimate is consistent with 2% inflation. In the UK, the most recent pace of wage growth is close to our economists’ estimate of the sustainable rate of 3%.\nWhat is the outlook for central bank rate cuts in 2026?\nAs with inflation, Goldman Sachs Research expects developed-market policy rates to converge lower in 2026. Three of the countries with higher policy rates—the US, UK, and Norway—are forecast to make further cuts.\nThe US Federal Reserve is projected to reduce its policy rate by 50 basis points to 3-3.25% in 2026. Goldman Sachs Research’s view is that the US inflation issue has been resolved, and there’s potential for the Fed to cut rates more than expected.\nOur economists’ baseline forecast for the UK is a sequence of quarterly rate cuts to 3% by the third quarter of 2026. Meanwhile Norway’s central bank is expected to cut rates by 50 basis points to 3.5% in 2026. The European Central Bank, by contrast, is expected to hold policy rates steady as inflation falls.\nThis article is being provided for educational purposes only.

        "original_content": "Research\n2026 Economic Outlook: Moderate Growth With a Range of Possibilities\nNov 19, 2025\nU.S. consumer spending and capital expenditures on AI are likely to drive moderate growth as global inflation slows.\nKey Takeaways\nAnnual global economic growth may moderate to 3% in 2025 and 3.2% in 2026, before stabilizing in 2027, helped by resilient consumption and capital spending.\nWith inflation continuing to moderate in most major economies, monetary policymakers in the U.S., UK and euro zone have room to cut rates.\nThe range of possible economic outcomes is wide, but healthy balance sheets and rising wealth are supporting U.S. consumption, while AI is boosting business expenditures.\nAlternative scenarios include stronger-than-expected demand in the U.S., surprising AI productivity gains—or a mild recession.\nThe year ahead brings an unusually broad range of possibilities for inflation and global growth. Global gross domestic product (GDP) is likely to moderate to an estimated 3% (4Q/4Q) in 2025 and 3.2% in both 2026 and 2027, while inflation cools across different regions, allowing policymakers to reduce interest rates further, according to Morgan Stanley Research.\nStrong household finances and\ngrowing wealth\nare keeping Americans spending. At the same time, businesses continue to invest in AI, even as the pace of those investments starts to level off.\n“These two factors—strength in consumption and business spending—were why we never called for a recession early in 2025, when markets pulled back on trade policy fears,” explains Seth Carpenter, Morgan Stanley’s Chief Global Economist. “The U.S. remains the most likely economy to drive material upside to global growth.”\nHowever, uncertainty remains high and the range of possible outcomes is wide: On one hand, consumer demand or AI-driven productivity could boost growth above the baseline forecast; on the other hand, the U.S. economy could be hit harder than expected by issues including monetary policy, tariffs and immigration.\n“The exact path depends on the strength of the consumer amid a slowing labor market and when AI adoption increases productivity gains meaningfully,” Carpenter says.\nVarying Levels of Growth in U.S., China and the Eurozone\nLooking beyond global numbers, the U.S. economy may slow notably in the first two quarters of 2026, but reaccelerate in the second half—helped by momentum in consumer and business spending, along with easier monetary and fiscal policy—to reach 1.8% real growth in GDP in 2026 and 2.0% in 2027. The potential for growth picks up as AI adoption drives productivity increases.\nChina’s real GDP is forecast to expand 5% in 2026, helped by front-loaded government policy support, followed by 4.5% in 2027 as the effect of fiscal stimulus wanes. Growth in the euro area is likely to remain moderate at 1.1% in 2026 and 1.3% in 2027 as German fiscal support is partially offset by consolidation in France and Italy.\nThe Disinflation Trend\nThe continued slowing of inflation is a global trend. In the U.S., the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, which the Federal Reserve watches closely, is forecast to rise in the first quarter of 2026 because of tariffs and immigration restrictions before resuming its gradual descent. Core PCE is forecast to be at 2.6% at the end of 2026 and 2.3% at the end of 2027.\nIn the euro area, the outlook is for headline inflation to undershoot the European Central Bank (ECB) target of 2%, with the economy running below its potential. Inflation is expected to run 1.7% at the end of 2026 and in 2027.\nIn Japan, headline and core inflation have been above target for the past couple of quarters, but the underlying trend has been weaker, prompting a forecast for inflation to edge below 2% in late 2026 and then rise back to policymakers’ 2% target in 2027. In China, core CPI inflation is likely to be positive, but the GDP deflator is expected to hover below 0% as the economy’s excess capacity dissipates only gradually.\nRate Cuts Across Regions\nGiven the benign inflation picture, monetary policy is forecast to move toward neutral across key economies. The Fed is likely to reduce rates through April, assuming that job growth in the U.S. is slow and any rise in core inflation is modest. The forecast expects an extended pause when the Fed’s target rate is at 3%-3.25%.\n“Even with the transition to a new Fed Chair in the second quarter of 2026, we expect the Fed’s reaction function to be roughly unchanged as most of the Committee itself will remain in place well into 2027,” Carpenter says.\nThe ECB has communicated that it plans to hold interest rates where they are. However, with slow growth and slack in the euro zone economy, and with inflation below target, the forecast is for two rate cuts in 2026, bringing their policy rate down to 1.5% by midyear. The Bank of England, on evidence of a softening economy and lower inflation, is forecast to bring rates down to 2.75% in 2026 before pausing.\nThe Bank of Japan, the only major developed market central bank that is hiking rates, is likely to increase its policy rate to 0.75% in December in the baseline forecast, and then remain on hold in 2026. Rate hikes may resume in 2027 and bring the policy rate to 1.25%.\nWeighing Alternative Scenarios\nThe outlook for the global economy is uncertain, and much depends on what happens in the U.S. If U.S. growth surprises to the upside, other countries could benefit too. But if the U.S. slows down more than expected, there’s a chance of a mild recession that could ripple across the world.\nThere may be demand-driven upside for U.S. growth. In this scenario, U.S. households and upbeat businesses—boosted by recent government spending and tax changes—could ramp up their investments. This could drive real U.S. GDP above 3% in 2026.\nA productivity-driven scenario is based on the possibility that adoption of AI could accelerate and its impact on the economy occur more quickly than expected. If productivity gets a big boost, the economy could grow faster than expected—even as prices stay low. Under this scenario unemployment holds steady in 2026, with businesses needing somewhat fewer workers, but without widespread job losses.\nThe scenario of a mild recession in the U.S. could adversely affect growth elsewhere, including Europe, Japan and China. The possibility is based on greater-than-expected slowing in the U.S. economy due to lagged effects from monetary policy, tariffs and immigration restrictions. If this occurs, real GDP growth quarter-on-quarter could turn negative in the first half of 2026 and unemployment could rise. In this scenario, the Fed eases but doesn’t go to zero because the contraction is mild.\n7275232\n63766\n3CD19151-F46C-4595-84CF-8EEC3E05FD19\nSign up to get Morgan Stanley Ideas delivered to your inbox.\nEmail Address\nEmail Address (Required)\nInvalid Email Address\nSubscribe\nThank You for Subscribing!\nWould you like to help us improve our coverage of topics that might interest you?

He is a specialist in global economic issues and the effects of economic, demographic, and social trends on the global business environment.\nikalish@deloitte.com\nForeword from Deloitte’s chief global economist\nAs anticipated in our last global economic outlook, elections around the world have driven notable policy changes that altered the trajectories of inflation, borrowing costs, currency values, and trade and capital flows in 2025. One significant development was that the United States raised significant barriers to trade, disrupting supply chains and creating financial market volatility. Since then, it has struck trade deals with numerous countries, reinstating some predictability in those trading relationships, albeit at higher costs. Restrictive US trade policy has also pushed other countries closer together, with numerous trade deals being inked among non-US countries.\nIn 2026, we expect to see the effects of these global policy shifts more clearly. Governments are adapting to a new geopolitical reality and adjusting their fiscal and structural policy plans accordingly. This will likely become more apparent in the new year. In addition, several countries are competing to remain at the frontier of technological innovation, particularly in artificial intelligence, while others are trying not to fall further behind. Significant investments to develop this innovation ecosystem are likely to continue in 2026. However, there is a risk that related spending has occurred too quickly and that a downward adjustment could be on the horizon.\nIn the following sections, economists from Deloitte’s firms offer their views on their respective countries’ outlooks for the coming year. We hope that readers will find these outlooks interesting, insightful, and helpful. Your feedback is most welcome, and our economists are available for more in-depth discussions on these matters.\nTable of contents\nForeword\nThe Americas\nThe Asia Pacific\nEurope, Middle East, and Africa\nThe Americas\nShare Infographic\nShare\nlinkedin\ntwitter\nfacebook\nOr copy link\nCopy\nArgentina\n–\nDaniel Zaga\nand\nFederico Di Yenno\nArgentina will enter 2026 after two years of profound macroeconomic adjustment that reshaped its policy framework and restored a degree of stability to an economy long challenged by chronic imbalances. The program launched in December 2023 combined fiscal consolidation, the elimination of central bank monetary financing, and a managed exchange-rate regime that began with a sharp devaluation and continued with a gradual crawl to anchor expectations.\nThese measures, reinforced by structural reforms and deregulation, delivered Argentina’s first primary fiscal surplus in over a decade—1.8% of gross domestic product in 2024\n1\n—and set the foundation for sustained disinflation.\nInflation, which peaked near 300% in 2024, is projected to fall to 29.4% in 2025 and 13.7% in 2026, supported by tight monetary policy and credible nominal anchors. Monthly inflation stabilized around 2% by late 2025, signaling progress toward price normalization and restoring confidence in the domestic currency.\nEconomic prospects have improved markedly. After contractions in 2023 and 2024, GDP growth is expected to rebound by 4% in 2025 and moderate to 3.5% in 2026 as the economy transitions from stabilization to expansion. The recovery is led by consumption and construction—sectors revitalized by wage recovery and private investment—while the energy and mining sectors emerge as strategic growth drivers.\nOil and gas production is accelerating thanks to the Vaca Muerta shale, supported by new pipelines and liquefied natural gas export projects, positioning Argentina as a net energy exporter and generating an energy trade surplus after years of deficits.\n2\nMining, particularly lithium and copper, is also set to benefit from the Large Investment Incentive Regime (or “RIGI”), which guarantees tax and foreign exchange stability for 30 years on projects exceeding US$200 million. Announced investments already surpass US$30 billion across energy, mining, and infrastructure, signaling strong investor confidence in Argentina’s resource potential and regulatory framework. This is expected to boost investment further, as these projects advance.\n3\nExternal accounts remain favorable, with a trade surplus projected at US$9 billion in 2025 and US$13 billion in 2026, despite imports recovering alongside investment-led growth.\n4\nNet international reserves of the central bank, which stood at negative US$11 billion in late 2023, are expected to turn positive in 2026, aided by International Monetary Fund disbursements and capital inflows under the RIGI. This improvement in reserves, combined with a credible fiscal anchor, has strengthened Argentina’s external position and reduced vulnerability to external shocks.\nFinancial conditions have also improved significantly. Country risk ratings fell from 2,500 basis points in late 2023 to around 600 by end-2025, reflecting fiscal consolidation, structural reforms, and progress in reserve accumulation. Argentina is expected to regain market access in 2026, contingent on sustained fiscal surpluses and continued credibility of the macroeconomic framework. This normalization of financial conditions will be critical for refinancing obligations and supporting long-term investment.\nStructural reforms—including tax restructuring, privatization frameworks, labor market modernization, and full capital account liberalization expected to be achieved in 2026—aim to consolidate competitiveness and attract long-term investment. These reforms, together with the RIGI, provide a stable and predictable environment for large-scale projects in energy, mining, and infrastructure, reinforcing Argentina’s potential as a regional hub for resource-based industries and renewable energy development.\nThe outlook for 2026 is therefore considerably more positive than in previous years. Argentina is projected to maintain fiscal discipline, deepen structural reforms, and leverage its resource endowment to secure growth while reducing inflation and restoring market confidence. The challenge ahead lies in sustaining credibility, accelerating regulatory normalization, and attracting foreign capital to consolidate the transition from stabilization to sustainable development. If these conditions are met, Argentina could enter a new phase of macroeconomic stability and investment-driven growth, reversing decades of volatility and positioning itself as a competitive player in global energy and mining markets.\nCanada\n– Dawn Desjardins\nThe Canadian economy is expected to continue to face challenges in 2026, although supportive monetary and fiscal policy will alleviate some of the stress; growth is projected to firm modestly following a subdued performance in 2025. The evolving geopolitical landscape will likely influence how Canada’s economy transitions in the year ahead. The government has introduced policy changes aimed at catalyzing business investment. Financial conditions are assumed to remain supportive, with the Bank of Canada expected to hold the policy rate steady throughout the year.\nThe key will be a recovery in business confidence, which dropped in 2025 amid growing concerns about Canada’s trading relationship with its largest partner, the United States. Tariff exemptions afforded by the United States–Mexico–Canada (USMCA) trade agreement are expected to remain in place in 2026, although the agreement review slated for July 2026 will likely keep businesses cautious. Consumers will feel relief from lower interest rates, although somewhat softer labor market conditions and slower immigration growth will keep spending in check.\nOverall, we expect the economy to grow at a slightly slower pace than 2025’s projected 1.7%. Canada’s governments are putting on a full-court press to spur investment by reducing regulatory hurdles and boosting infrastructure spending. The federal government’s budget includes measures that will help the supply side of the economy by greenlighting large projects in the resource sector and infrastructure, boosting defense spending while supporting sectors impacted by US tariffs, and encouraging trade diversification. These measures, combined with provincial government initiatives, are expected to make a solid contribution to GDP growth in 2026 and beyond.\nLabor market conditions softened in early 2025, especially in sectors most impacted by US tariffs, including steel and aluminum, lumber, and finished autos. The unemployment rate trended higher and was over 1.7 percentage points above the post-pandemic low in November 2025.\n5\nBusiness outlook surveys indicated that employers aren’t looking to increase their workforce over the year ahead but, importantly, are also not looking to cut employees. Therefore, the labor market will likely remain soft; and with labor force growth reversing after strong immigration-led gains in 2023 and 2024, the unemployment rate is projected to remain around current levels.\nInflation trended higher in 2025 from the lows of mid-2024, with the headline rate in line with the Bank of Canada’s 2% target and underlying measures trading closer to the top of the 1%-to-3% target band.\n6\nInflation expectations, however, remain contained, and given the economy expanded below its potential pace for three successive years, price pressures are expected to remain limited. Risks of price escalation from disrupted supply chains and increased costs of Canadian imports will likely persist in 2026",

        "original_content": "Standing room only as IBM’s Borja Peropadre lays out the roadmap to quantum advantage, and why 2026 could be the inflection point\nIBM expects “strong claims of quantum advantage” to emerge this year. That was the headline message from Borja Peropadre, who leads a team of algorithm engineers at IBM Quantum, speaking to a packed room at the Fontainebleau’s CES Foundry in Las Vegas.\nPeropadre was direct about IBM’s mission: “Our mission at IBM is to bring useful quantum computing to the world.” He outlined a roadmap first published in 2019, since extended to 2033, noting that “year over year, we’ve been delivering in that vision and in this roadmap.”\nThe presentation centred on three milestones. The first, “quantum utility,” was achieved in 2023. The second, quantum advantage, is expected this year. The third, fault-tolerant quantum computing with error correction, is targeted for 2029.\nPeropadre referenced a prediction made by Jay Gambetta, then vice president of IBM Quantum and now Director of IBM Research, at Supercomputing 2024: “My prediction is quantum advantage is going to happen in the next two years. But only if HPC and quantum communities work together.” Peropadre added: “So we are entering into that year now.”\nThe case for 2026\nIBM’s confidence stems from a 2023 paper that, as Peropadre put it, “created a lot of excitement and a lot of confusion.” The paper demonstrated that a noisy quantum computer using 127 qubits and almost 3,000 two-qubit gates produced accurate expectation values “beyond the capabilities of brute force classical computation.”\nPeropadre illustrated the significance with a thought experiment. “Imagine that I give you these ten white boxes. Each of them is a computing machine.” Nine were state-of-the-art classical simulators using approximate algorithms. One was a quantum computer. The outcome: “The quantum computer is the one that is basically on the average of all these things.”\nThat might sound underwhelming, but Peropadre explained the implications: “There are problems out there where we don’t have brute force exact classical algorithms. And quantum computers can help today to bring solutions or provide solutions where approximate methods really struggle.”\nIBM has defined two criteria for quantum advantage. The first is “quantum separation,” which Peropadre described as “this provable separation or this provable outperformance in efficiency, time to solution, accuracy, or quality.” The second is validation: “If I have a quantum computer that produces a faster outcome than a classical computer, but I don’t have brute force or exact classical algorithms that can verify or can tell me that this result is accurate, how can I believe that the quantum computer is doing the right thing? This is what we mean by validation. We need to make sure that the output is rigorously validated.”\nIBM has identified three families of problems where noisy quantum computers can produce verifiable results. The first is “observable estimation,” covering dynamics in materials and chemistry. The second is “variational problems,” such as computing the ground state or minimum energy of molecules. Peropadre explained: “If you get an energy that is lower than the best classical method, we know that there will be quantum advantage there.” The third category is “classically verifiable” problems, like Shor’s algorithm for factoring: “If you want to know if that solution is right, you just need to multiply the two smaller numbers and see if the number that you have is right or not.”\nIBM is already running experiments across these categories. Using “mirror circuits,” which Peropadre described as circuits that are “easy for us to verify” because “we do one operation on the contrary, so basically it does nothing,” IBM tested two independent quantum computers: IBM Boston and IBM Pittsburgh, both running Heron chips. “We got the same result. This is giving us the feeling that we are getting strong confirmation that we are approaching to compute problems that are beyond what classical computers can produce.”\nOn variational problems, quantum computers are “starting to outperform the best classical methods that have been the legacy methods in quantum chemistry over the years.” Peropadre called this “another direction where we see potential for quantum computers to outperform classical methods in 2026.”\nBut he was candid about the competition: “A few days before we were going to present these results, we came ourselves with a classical method that was much better than the quantum computer. I don’t think this is something… this is the nature of science. This is what’s going to happen in the next few years. We’re going to see this feedback loop of quantum basically trying to outperform classical but classical trying to outperform quantum.”\nHe added a significant qualifier: “We don’t think there’s going to be a strong claim or a final goal post that says quantum advantage has been achieved on this. I think it’s super healthy from a scientific standpoint that we keep working with the classical community and that we keep seeing this evolution of classical and quantum algorithms together.”\nTo track this competition, IBM and partners including Algorithmiq, the Flatiron Institute, and BlueQubit have created open-source “advantage trackers.” Peropadre explained: “You can go online, you can check it’s open source, and you can basically follow kind of the race between classical and quantum computers.” Researchers post their institution, method, circuit details, qubit and gate counts, and results. “We really expect and we really hope that this gets a lot of traction this year. Everybody joins, everybody puts their results.”\nThe hardware pipeline\nPeropadre walked through the progression of IBM’s quantum processors, using the number of two-qubit gates as the key metric for circuit complexity.\n“In 2016, when we put the first quantum computer on the cloud, we had a quantum complexity of three two-qubit gates. Fast forward to 2023, when we did this utility paper, we get almost to 3,000 gates. Last year, we already achieved 5,000 two-qubit gates.”\nThe\nroadmap\nprojects continued growth: “By the end of this year, we’re going to have 7,500 two-qubit gates, and we’ll go up to 100 million gates by 2029, and a billion gates by 2033.”\nThe utility results were achieved on the\nHeron processor\n, which has a “heavy-hex topology.” IBM has since released\nNighthawk\n, a 120-qubit chip with a square lattice design. “This chip is able to produce up to 30% more complex quantum circuits than the ones that I described,” Peropadre said. “We expect that this is going to be like our flagship for achieving quantum advantage this year.”\nNighthawk is available to IBM premium clients and partners in the IBM Quantum Network. Peropadre showed a chart comparing IBM’s fleet to competitors including Rigetti, QuEra, Quantinuum, IQM, and IonQ, noting that “all of IBM quantum computers, the entire fleet, is well into what we call the utility region.”\nError correction, which Peropadre described as necessary for “a very robust quantum computer,” is targeted for 2029. Until then, IBM relies on error mitigation techniques. “For the most part, running GPUs and CPUs. So you already start seeing that picture of quantum is not working in isolation. It has to work orchestrated with classical computing resources.”\nWhat remains uncertain\nHardware alone will not deliver quantum advantage. “We need to do algorithm discovery,” Peropadre said. “We need to find more algorithms that really apply to different applications.”\nHe cited the variational quantum eigensolver, discovered around 2014, as an example: “That was a real disruption in the field, and everybody started working in variational algorithms. The progress over the years has been slow but steady.”\nBut the real breakthroughs come from new algorithms entirely. “The thing that is really disruptive is the discovery of new algorithms. Something that really changed the game in chemistry was finding new algorithms, like the SQD algorithms, sampling-based quantum diagonalisation algorithms, that brought the number of qubits from around 30 to 80.”\nThe lesson, Peropadre argued, is that access drives discovery: “Many of the algorithms that have been discovered, even in the past, it’s been when scientists had access to computers. So now these are machines that people, the community have access to. People need to start trying their quantum algorithms in these machines.”\nIBM has identified four application domains: Hamiltonian simulation (covering “chemistry or material science or how quantum systems evolve”), optimisation (“from optimising portfolios in finance” to protein folding, which involves “a massive exponential number of possibilities that a protein has to fold over itself”), machine learning, and differential equations (“the behaviour of aeroplanes in certain turbulent landscapes”).\nSpecific applications Peropadre highlighted included pharmaceuticals (“how small molecules have a direct link to a pocket in a target”) and battery development (“lithium ion, very fundamental molecules and chemical reactions”).\nIBM’s Quantum Network has over 100 active test cases with partners including RIKEN, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and Boeing. “We are very aware that quantum advantage is not going to come through IBM alone,” Peropadre said. “We need our partners and the experts in these different verticals to come and tell us where we need to look for it.”\nTags:\nCES 2026\nIBM",

Breakthroughs in agent interoperability, self-verification, and memory will transform AI from isolated tools into integrated systems that can handle complex, multi-step workflows. Meanwhile, open-source foundation models will break the grip of AI giants and accelerate innovation.\nHere are six predictions for how AI capabilities will evolve in 2026.\nOpen-source models will break the hold of AI giants\nBy 2026, the power of foundation models will no longer be limited to a handful of companies. The biggest breakthroughs are now occurring in the post-training phase, where models are refined with specialized data. This shift will enable a wave of open-source models that can be customized and fine-tuned for specific applications. This democratization will allow nimble startups and researchers to create powerful, tailored AI solutions on a shared, open foundation—effectively breaking the monopoly and accelerating a new wave of distributed AI development.\nImprovements in context windows and memory will drive agentic innovation\nWith improvements in foundation models slowing, the next frontier is\nagentic AI\n. In 2026, the focus will be on building intelligent, integrated systems that have capabilities such as context windows and human-like memory. While new models with more parameters and better reasoning are valuable, models are still limited by their lack of working memory. Context windows and improved memory will drive the most innovation in agentic AI next year, by giving agents the persistent memory they need to learn from past actions and operate autonomously on complex, long-term goals. With these improvements, agents will move beyond the limitations of single interactions and provide continuous support.\nSelf-verification will start to replace human intervention\nIn 2026, the biggest obstacle to scaling AI agents—the build up of errors in multi-step workflows—will be solved by self-verification. Instead of relying on human oversight for every step, AI will be equipped with internal feedback loops, allowing them to autonomously verify the accuracy of their own work and correct mistakes. This shift to self-aware, “auto-judging” agents will allow for complex, multi-hop workflows that are both reliable and scalable, moving them from a promising concept to a viable enterprise solution.\nEnglish will become the hottest new programming language\nThe single most important proving ground for AI’s reasoning capabilities is in coding. An AI’s ability to generate and execute code provides a critical bridge from the statistical, non-deterministic world of\nlarge language models\nto the deterministic, symbolic logic of computers. This is unlocking a new era of English language programming, where the primary skill is not knowing a specific syntax like\nGo\nor\nPython\n, but being able to clearly articulate a goal to an AI assistant. By 2026, the bottleneck in building new products will no longer be the ability to write code, but the ability to creatively shape the product itself. This shift will democratize software development, leading to a tenfold increase in the number of creators who can now build applications and do higher-value, creative work.\nThe AI arms race will shift from bigger models to smarter ones\nThe era of adding more compute and data to build ever-larger foundation models is ending. In 2025, we hit a wall with established scaling laws like the\nChinchilla formula\n. The industry is running out of high-quality pre-training data, and the token horizons needed for training have become unmanageably long. That means the race to build the biggest models will finally slow down. Instead, innovation is rapidly shifting to post-training techniques, where companies are dedicating an increasing portion of their compute resources. This means the focus in 2026 won’t be on sheer size of AI models, but on refining and specializing models with techniques like reinforcement learning to make them dramatically more capable for specific tasks.\nAgent interoperability will unlock the next wave of AI productivity\nToday, most AI agents operate in walled gardens, unable to communicate or collaborate with agents from other platforms. That’s about to change. By 2026, the next major frontier in enterprise AI will be interoperability—the development of open standards and protocols that allow disparate AI agents to speak to one another. Just as the API economy connected different software services, an “agent economy” will allow agents from different platforms to autonomously discover, negotiate, and exchange services with one another. Solving this challenge will unlock compound efficiencies and automate complex, multi-platform workflows that are impossible today, ushering in the next wave of AI-driven productivity.\nThe new technical priorities for 2026\nRather than pursuing raw scale, the industry is solving the practical problems that prevent AI from working reliably in production. Self-verification eliminates error accumulation in multi-step workflows. Improved memory transforms one-off interactions into continuous partnerships.\nAdvances like these mark a maturation of the field. The organizations that can best capitalize on them will recognize that the era of “bigger is better” has given way to an era of “smarter is essential.” Technical progress in AI isn’t slowing, it’s getting more sophisticated.\n—\nNew Tech Forum\nprovides a venue for technology leaders—including vendors and other outside contributors—to explore and discuss emerging enterprise technology in unprecedented depth and breadth.

They’ve been willing to use the most extreme language, the most extreme actions, and to take part in direct confrontations on the streets,” he said.\nMunayyer drew a parallel to earlier extremist groups, such as the Jewish Defense League (JDL), founded in New York City during the late 1960s by the Jewish anti-Arab hardliner Meir Kahane.\nThe JDL embraced violent street action and would go on to carry out numerous armed attacks on opponents, earning it a designation as a right-wing terrorist organisation by the US government in the early 2000s.\nBetar also draws inspiration from the Zionist hardliner Ze’ev Jabotinsky, who called for an unapologetically militant version of Zionism and advocated the violent expulsion of Palestinians from lands sought for a Jewish state.\n“Prime Minister Netanyahu’s late father, Benzion was longtime secretary to Ze’ev Jabotinsky, and Netanyahu is one of Jabotinsky’s greatest students,” Betar said in a social media post on Tuesday, stating that it denied “all allegations of wrongdoing”.\nAdvertisement\n“Betar is mainstream Zionism,” it added.",

So I am told that it has the ear of the government, because that’s a good chunk of the electorate. And the community of mothers on Mumsnet crosses divisions of class, faith, ethnicity.\nThis campaign is about mothers for mothers. The situation being endured by mothers in Gaza is unimaginably brutal and horrific.\nWe want to galvanise the mums of Great Britain to speak up for the mums of Gaza through their communities, one of which – and probably the most powerful – is Mumsnet. Many people express the desire and need to do something in relation to the suffering they see in Gaza and across the occupied territories, but they don’t know what or how. This campaign is something they can join with if they want to.\nAl Jazeera: As a mother yourself, how has it felt watching the genocide unfold?\nStevenson:\nHonestly, unspeakable. Sometimes I feel beside myself.\nEverybody in the world loves their children in the same way. Palestinian parents love their children just as much as we do. How can our politicians sit back and watch what these parents are enduring? And watch the unimaginable suffering being inflicted on children?\nThere are more child\namputees\nnow in\nGaza\nthan in any other time or place in history. There are many children who have\nlost all their family\n, young children without parents or family left. There are parents who have no children left. There are pregnant\nmothers\nwho are starving, giving birth to premature and very underweight babies who struggle to survive. Most of Gaza’s healthcare system has been destroyed, and where hospitals are still functioning, they do so with a chronic lack of equipment and medicines. There are minimal resources for\nmaternal and neonatal care\n. The infant mortality rate has leapt up by 75 percent, and miscarriages by 300 percent.\nAny mother in the world seeing this situation would be haunted and horrified, I think. I would hope so.\nAl Jazeera: For many years, you’ve protested for the rights of Palestinians. What’s behind your activism, something that, as we have seen, comes with risk to careers?\nStevenson:\nI learned about the situation of the Palestinian people many years ago. It struck me from the very first as a narrative of extreme injustice. My husband is Jewish and his mum, my beloved mother-in-law, was a refugee from Hitler’s Vienna [Austria was annexed by the Nazis in 1938 and liberated in 1945].\nJuliet Stevenson attends a pro-Palestinian protest outside 10 Downing Street, a demonstration featuring the banging of pots and pans to honour the Palestinians shot while queuing for food in Gaza, in London, Britain, July 25, 2025 [Isabel Infantes/Reuters]\nI fully understand what the Holocaust left in its wake, and the need for the Jewish people to feel secure and safe – and never again to be vulnerable to the appalling ravages of anti-Semitism. But as many, many Jews are now saying, what the Israeli government is doing now, what has been perpetrated on the Palestinian people since\n1948\n, was never a just or wise solution. The UK is\ndeeply implicated\nin those historical events.\nAdvertisement\nI read Edward Said and other Palestinian writers, and I read Israeli writers … I’m concerned with the safety and security of Israeli citizens, too. The brutality lashed out against Gaza and the occupied territories serves nobody in the region.\nAs for careers, my career – I honestly feel that if people don’t want to work with me because they don’t like what I’m saying about this, then I don’t think I want to work with them. And if they’re going to punish me for my belief system, then I probably don’t belong there. And most importantly, I don’t think my career is more important than the lives of Palestinian children. I really, really don’t.\nAnd when I come to the end of my life, whenever that is, I want to be able to look back at my life and say I hope I did the right thing at the right time.\nOf course, I want to go on working as an actor; I love the work. And I need my platform and my profile to be able to be effective – that’s important, too. But I haven’t yet felt that I’ve been penalised for activism – I’ve never worked as hard or as much as I did last year. So I’m optimistic that there are enough people in the industry who don’t want to punish me for this, and who feel the same.\nAl Jazeera: How do you characterise the muted response to the genocide in Gaza from usually outspoken characters in the arts or feminists who speak up about oppression in other regions of the world?\nStevenson:\nI’m painfully disappointed by the silence in my industry, by the silence everywhere. I’m dismayed by how people are allowing the bullying into silence to be effective – by their yielding to that power. At this point in the genocide, silence is not a passive act. It’s active – it’s a decision to collude.\nWe look back at Germany at the time of the Holocaust, and we harshly judge those who didn’t speak out against that barbarism, and we admire those who did. But what about the current genocide? Why do we so often look back at history and assess it in that way, but we don’t bring those judgements to bear on the world we’re living in now?\nI do wish more leading figures in the arts, and more arts and cultural institutions, would engage with what is happening in Palestine and use their voices and influence. It’s our job, isn’t it, to reflect the human condition, human experience? If we’re not doing that in relation to the genocide, then I don’t know what we are doing, really.\nAl Jazeera: Several British actors over the years, yourself included and Vanessa Redgrave, have criticised Israeli policy that disregards Palestinian rights. Has the space for speaking up become more restrictive in recent years?\nStevenson:\nI’d like to acknowledge Vanessa’s astonishing legacy of always speaking out and always fighting for human rights. She’s been a really inspiring person in our industry doing that. And I would also like to acknowledge the voice and the actions of many young people in my industry now – not famous or with high profile, but who are really engaged and tirelessly support the Stop the War movement, and who call for humanity and action. It takes bravery – as it does in\nHollywood\n, where a few have stood up and spoken out. I’m so grateful that they found the courage. … But most people have not.\nThere was a great wave of public support that grew during last summer. My great fear now is that it’s subsiding again – the illusion of the\nso-called “ceasefire”\nhas taken hold – when in fact there has been\nno ceasefire\n[and] much of the mainstream media colludes. There is, in addition, so much distraction in the news because of world events elsewhere …  and then of course there is the power of\nIsrael’s propaganda machine\n, which is immense and far-reaching.\nAdvertisement\nAl Jazeera: What propels you to keep going?\nStevenson:\nIt’s vitally important to keep Palestine conscious in people’s minds – to sustain its presence in the media. To keep the movement for peace and justice alive and energised.\nMy values have shifted, my community of friendships has partly shifted, my work and general interests have shifted. Much has changed for me in relation to this. A lot of the people I spend time with now are people who are in this community, and who will not give up hope. My mantra in life is one that I adopted when I was very young – “Despair is a luxury we cannot afford.”\nAl Jazeera: Does your family join your activism?\nStevenson:\nMy husband Hugh [Brody], though not religious, feels his Jewish identity very deeply. Our children identify as Jewish. And ",

        "original_content": "2026 is a tipping point year.\nThat’s not because we should expect a coming confrontation between the two biggest powers, the U.S. and China. Nor are tensions between the U.S. and Russia likely to spiral out of control this year. Instead, 2026 looks set to be a time of great geopolitical uncertainty, because the U.S. is unwinding its own global order.\n1. U.S. political revolution\nWhat began as tactical norm-breaking has become a system-level transformation: President Donald Trump’s attempt to systematically dismantle the\nchecks on his power\n, capture the machinery of government, and weaponize it against his domestic enemies. With many of the guardrails that held in Trump’s first term\nnow buckling\n, we can no longer say with confidence what kind of political system the U.S. will be when this revolution is over. Ultimately, the revolution is more likely to fail than succeed, but there will be no going back to the status quo. The U.S. will be the principal source of global risk this year.\nA Minute of Your Time: Trump’s Potential Next Targets After Venezuela\n2. Overpowered\nThe defining technologies of the 21st century run on electrons: EVs, drones, robots, batteries, AI. All require the “electric stack.” China has mastered it, becoming the first “\nelectrostate\n.” The U.S. is ceding it, cementing the country’s status as the\nworld’s largest petrostate\n. In 2026, that divergence will become impossible to ignore. While Washington asks countries to buy 20th-century energy, Beijing offers 21st-century infrastructure at\nknockoff prices\n. Emerging markets will increasingly favor China’s offering. The cumulative effect is a geopolitical turning point: A growing share of the world’s energy, mobility, and industrial systems will be built on Chinese foundations, bringing Beijing commercial benefits and influence that soft power alone could never deliver. The AI race raises the stakes—the U.S. may build the best models, but China\nmay win the market\nif it can power and deploy AI at scale.\nAdvertisement\n3. The Donroe Doctrine\nPresident Trump is\nreviving and reinterpreting\nthe logic of the Monroe Doctrine in an effort to assert U.S. primacy over the Western Hemisphere. The big news this year is\nVenezuela\n, where Washington’s escalating regime-change campaign has resulted in a headline win for Trump with Nicolás Maduro\n’s ouster and\ntrial\nin the U.S. But taking out Maduro was the easy part; transitioning to a stable, U.S.-friendly, if not democratic government will be more challenging. Across the region, heavy-handed American tactics will risk spurring backlash and unintended consequences.\nRead More:\nTrump's Goals in Venezuela Don't Add Up\n4. Europe under siege\nFrance, Germany, and the U.K. each enter the year with\nweak\n,\nunpopular\ngovernments\nunder siege from the populist right, the populist left, and the Trump Administration. All three risk paralysis at best and destabilization at worst—and at least one leader could fall. Europe’s ability to address its\neconomic malaise\n, fill the security vacuum left by America’s retreat, and sustain support for Ukraine past 2026 will suffer. If Washington overtly interferes in European elections or takes the dramatic step of\nannexing Greenland\n, the postwar alliance framework, already strained, could fracture.\nAdvertisement\n5. Russia’s second front\nThe most dangerous front in Europe this year will shift from the trenches in Donetsk to the hybrid war between Russia and NATO as Vladimir Putin seeks to erode European support for Ukraine before economic strain impairs his ability to prosecute the hot war. After years of absorbing punishment, NATO will for the first time push back on Russia’s\ngray-zone operations\n. The alliance will\nshoot down drones\n, hold exercises close to the Russian border, and take tougher offensive cyber action. This combination will result in more frequent and dangerous confrontations in the heart of Europe. As all sides grow more risk-acceptant, the margin for error will narrow.\n6. State capitalism with American characteristics\nThe most economically interventionist administration since the New Deal will entrench further in 2026. Trump’s\nstate capitalism\nis personal and transactional: Businesses that\nalign with him\nreceive favorable treatment; those that don’t risk finding themselves at a disadvantage. The toolkit is expansive and includes tariffs,\nequity stakes\n,\nrevenue-sharing deals\n, regulatory leverage,\ninvestment-for-market-access agreements\n. The transactional logic extends to foreign governments as well. With midterms approaching and economic discontent rising, Trump will double down on interventionism rather than pull back. Tariffs will face constraints this year, so the Administration will rely on other tools, picking winners and losers at a scale not seen in modern U.S. history. The precedent will stick for future administrations.\nAdvertisement\n7. China’s deflation trap\nChina’s\ndeflationary spiral\nwill deepen and Beijing won’t do anything to stop it. With the 21st Party Congress looming in 2027, Xi Jinping will prioritize political control and technological supremacy over the consumption stimulus that could break the cycle and prevent a Japanese-style “lost decade.” The pain will fall hardest on the young, who are increasingly giving up on the “China Dream.” Beijing will keep trying to\nexport\nits way out, flooding global markets—an approach that most trading partners may absorb this year but won’t tolerate forever.\n8. AI eats its users\nAI is a revolutionary technology, but it can’t yet live up to investor expectations. Under growing pressure to justify sky-high valuations and unconstrained by guardrails, a number of leading AI companies will adopt extractive business models (such as experimenting with ads embedded in conversations where, unlike traditional search, there’s no way to distinguish neutral information from paid influence) that threaten social and political stability—like social media, but worse. Social media captured attention; AI programs behavior, shapes thoughts, and mediates reality. The near-term threat is not superhuman machines but the decline of thinking, feeling, and social humans.\nAdvertisement\nRead More:\nThe Architects of AI Are TIME’s 2025 Person of the Year\n9. Zombie USMCA\nNorth American trade will be stuck in limbo this year. The USMCA won’t be extended, updated, or killed—it will stagger on as a zombie, keeping businesses and governments guessing. Trump doesn’t want a new trilateral deal; the zombie agreement lets him keep squeezing Mexico and Canada for bilateral concessions.\nTariff exemptions\nfor compliant goods will hold, but for sectors the U.S. wants to reshore—autos, steel, aluminum—the days of free and predictable North American trade are over.\n10. The water weapon\nWater is already one of the most contested shared resources on the planet, but it is increasingly becoming a loaded weapon. Half of humanity\nalready lives under water stress\n, and there’s no architecture to manage it. In 2026, the governance vacuum will deepen—the Indus Waters Treaty\nsuspended\n, Ethiopia’s Nile dam\noperational\nwith no binding agreement, China\nbuilding\nthe world’s largest dam with no downstream treaty. In Africa, extremists\nexploit\nungoverned water scarcity to recruit and control populations. In South Asia, nuclear-armed rivals are turning rivers into leverage. No single crisis may erupt this year. But the weapons are loaded, the guardrails are off, and when the next shock comes, water will make it worse.\nAdvertisement\nRed herrings—the risks that are overrated\n“Tariff-man” at large\nTrump’s unilateralist instincts are intact, but his trade leverage will be more constrained going forward. China’s rare earth leverage pushed him toward a\ndeal\nrather than a fight he couldn’t win. The economic order is increasingly multipolar, and other countries have options. With the midterms approaching, Trump will have less room for tariffs that drive up prices.\nRead More:\nWhy Trump Will Blink First on China\nDe-globalization\nDespite stagnant trade growth and elevated tariffs, globalization grinds on. Peak tariffs are behind us, and countries outside the U.S. want to preserve the system while hedging.\nNew\ntrade deals\nare still being struck even as tariffs grab headlines, and supply chains remain sticky. De-risking is not de-globalization.\nSpheres of influence\nThe Western Hemisphere elevated in U.S. strategy, deals with Xi,\nacceptance of Russian gains\n—it looks like a 19th-century carve-up. But the U.S. remains a global power with global ambitions, just pursued more transactionally. The law of the jungle is back. Spheres of influence aren’t—the world is both too interconnected to carve up and too fragmented to hold together.\nAdvertisement\nSell America\nAfter\n“Liberation Day,”\npundits declared American exceptionalism dead. Yet the dollar remains the safe haven, and the U.S. remains the\nmost investable major economy\n. The reason: TINA (there is no alternative). The U.S. is too big, too innovative, and too hard to replace.",

        "original_content": "For years, the\nwellness\nindustry has played a game of “whack a mole” — solving one problem just for another to pop up, according to Caroline Weintraub, vice president at investment firm True Beauty Ventures. This year, the game is over.\n“We are not at an equilibrium. People have been trying to individually target various different pieces,” she said. “This year, we’re going to start thinking about these things more holistically.”\nMuch like “longevity,” “holistic” is a term that crops up often within the wellness industry. But 2026’s overarching themes point to a broadening of how shoppers define their health. Widespread wearables tracking data, combined with a renewed interest in ancient practices like ayurveda and traditional Chinese medicine, has reframed the body as an interconnected system, highway or engine — not a random list of problems to solve.\nIt’s created a new wellness customer, who might tackle poor sleep quality with a magnesium-based supplement — but who will also look at high-tech solutions like system-regulating neuromodulators, as well as the basics, like curbing screen time.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMuch like the body and its systems, this year’s key themes are interconnected. In 2026, the untetherable gut, brain, sleep connection will be common knowledge, while the knock-on effects of GLP-1 induced weight loss will crop-up in approaches to nutrition and overall wellbeing.\n“Across all of these trends the common thread is regulation: blood sugar, digestion, stress, hormones, appetite and mood,” said Alyssa Williams, trend forecasting firm Spate’s wellness insights manager. “Consumers are prioritising steadiness and sustainability over extremes.”\nFibre as the New “It” Nutrient\nThe term “fibremaxxing” cropped up repeatedly in 2025, but 2026 will be the essential carbohydrate’s blockbuster year. According to Spate’s proprietary popularity index, which tracks interest and engagement across Google and TikTok, searches for fibre are up 43.8 percent year on year, with searches for fibre supplements up 62.3 percent.\nThe increased interest reflects fibre’s new positioning beyond nutrient to “multi-benefit wellness solution,” said Williams. “Beyond digestive health, consumers are increasingly associating fibre with hormonal balance (including PCOS), metabolic health, fullness and gut-brain support,” she said\nWeintraub adds that the gut–brain–skin connection — “the expansion of gut health beyond digestion into cognition, mood, and visible skin outcomes” — will also be a key driver.\nFibre’s relationship to gut health is firmly on the mind, evidenced by the rapid ascension of prebiotic sodas, up 71.4 percent year-over-year, with interest from shoppers and investors alike. Independent soda brand Olipop, whose sodas contain six to nine grams of plant-derived fibre per can, was valued at $1.85 billion in a February 2025 funding round. Its biggest competitor Poppi, whose sodas contain around two to five grams of fibre per can, was\nacquired by PepsiCo\nfor $1.95 billion in May 2025.\n“Gut health is becoming a daily lifestyle habit, not a supplement routine, and we’re seeing both legacy CPG brands and supplement companies racing into the space,” said Williams.\nThe Oncoming GLP-1 Pill Wave\nBetween\nNovo Nordisk\nand\nEli Lilly\n’s global battle to own the GLP-1 category, and US president\nDonald Trump\nstriking a deal to slash prices, weight-loss drugs will become more accessible and convenient in 2026.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPer Spate, searches related to GLP-1 pill formats are up 993.2 percent year-over-year, reflecting not only interest from potential patients but also the\nclosely watched race\nto bring weight-loss pills to market. On Dec. 22, the FDA approved Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy pill, which\nhit the US market\nthis week. In late-stage trials, Novo’s pill showed an average weight loss of 16.6 percent over 64 weeks, comparable results to its injectable GLP-1.\nThe pill format, as well as increasing insurance coverage, indicate that in 2026, “every single person who wants to be on a GLP-1 will be,” Weintraub said.\nWider adoption will see a surge in side effects. “Say if you take it and you’re losing hair, or you don’t have the right nutrients because you’re not eating as much and then the supplements you take to support that. It compounds everything,” Weintraub said.\nTracking, Data and AI-Assisted Optimisation\nTechnological wearables that allow users to track their sleep, exercise and blood oxygen levels will become increasingly widespread in 2026. Big players such as Finnish company\nOura\n(valued at\n$1 billion\nin 2025) and subscription-based Whoop (valued most recently in 2021 at $3.6 billion) will continue to show impressive adoption rates. Earlier this week, the\nFDA announced\nthat it would be limiting any stringent regulation of the devices — a further boost.\n“Interestingly, we’re now moving beyond passive observation. We’re not just looking at the data, we’re making new habits based on it,” said Olivia Houghton, head of beauty and wellness at consultancy the Future Laboratory. An average of two new healthy behaviours are being formed off the back of these devices, according to Pan European, with 87 percent reporting changes like improved sleep habits and increased exercise frequency.\nWearables’ endless insight into individuals’ precise health needs has created a supplement opportunity. According to David Hamlette, a wellness insights analyst at Mintel, personalisation and hyperspecificity will become increasingly key for vitamin and minerals brands from 2026 all the way through 2030. “There’s a focus on tailoring the supplement specifically to what someone needs,” said Hamlette.\nIn addition to this data, the specificity charge will be empowered by AI. Hamlette mentioned Nourished, a brand using AI to harness personal data in producing bespoke, individualised gummies. UK-based Healf, an AI-powered wellbeing company and retailer, has also found success by emphasising individualised routines: This week, it announced Claudia Schiffer as an ambassador and investor, after achieving an annual growth rate of 434 percent in 2025, per\nThe Sunday Times\n.\nTargeting Stress With a Human Touch\nFor Williams, the most surprising wellness breakout product is scalp massagers, with 48.1 percent YoY growth, and especially strong momentum on Instagram, up 183 percent YoY. “What’s notable is why people are searching,” she said: per Spate, search interest in and social engagement of scalp massagers directly linked to anxiety across Google, TikTok and Instagram are up 1,000 percent YoY.\nADVERTISEMENT\nInterest in at-home devices that purport to calm the nervous system using sound and vibration is also growing. Leading the charge is the headset-resembling Pulsetto FIT, stocked at Boots and Healf since late 2025, and the recipient of endorsement from biohacking entrepreneur Bryan Johnson. In 2025, Pulsetto reached $10 million in revenue — triple that of its previous year — according to the company’s CEO.\nThere is also the community factor. “You’re seeing more exclusive-experiences, more in-person events, because people crave that connection and community and real in-person touch,” said Weintraub. The handfuls of\nmembers-based wellness clubs\ncropping up in cities globally will continue to thrive — and Equinox executive Harvey Spevak recently told\nThe Wall Street Journal\nthe chain is expanding its lounge spaces “dramatically.”\nTreatments like lymphatic drainage massages will once again be spotlighted as people seek touch-based energy invigoration, said Mallory Huron, head of beauty and wellness forecasting at Future Snoops. Globally, Google searches for lymphatic drainage massages have doubled since January 2025.\nA Focus on Focus\nOptimising brain power and boosting productivity will be huge focuses in the coming year, said Weintraub, who calls the trend a “focus on focus.” “We are so distracted as a population, our attention spans and brains have suffered,” she said. “The question is: What can I do to support that?”\nIn consumer goods, this will sustain demand for products targeting cognitive function like\nMoon Juice\n’s new Neuro Magnesi-Om mushroom matcha powder.\nTraditional trackables also have a part to play here, as the prosaic steps to boost cognitive function — sleep, exercise — continue to be emphasised. But there are also new technological breakthroughs. Along with Elon Musk’s Neuralink and its competitor Synchron, tech company Neurable recently launched focus-monitoring, AI-powered headphones — a sort of wearable for tracking cognitive function.\nSome are approaching the brain conversation differently. Chronodieting — timing eating to one’s biological clocks to boost energy levels — is gaining traction, as is the more old-fashioned concept of unplugging. “Brain health is linked to cognitive function. People need to put down their phones and pick up hobbies again,” said Huron.\nSign up to\nThe Business of Beauty newsletter\n, your complimentary, must-read source for the day’s most important beauty and wellness news and analysis.",

Before joining Deloitte, Hung served as research manager at the Center for Energy Studies at the Baker Institute for Public Policy in Houston, Texas.\nelhung@deloitte.com\n2025 has been a challenging year for renewables. The new tax law, commonly referred to as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, rolled back many clean energy tax credits and imposed new restrictions, pressuring early-stage wind and solar pipelines. Wind and solar investments in the first half of 2025 fell 18%, to nearly US$35 billion (prior to the enactment of this act), compared to the same period in 2024.\n1\nStill, renewables dominated US capacity growth, accounting for 93% of additions (30.2 gigawatts) through September 2025, with solar and storage making up 83%.\n2\nDeployment could surge in 2026 as developers shift to safe-harbor projects, while the new foreign entity of concern (FEOC) sourcing rules—restrictions targeting entities linked to covered nations (China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea) through ownership, control, or jurisdiction—take effect.\n3\nWith only 35% of the pipeline under construction, renewable starts are expected to accelerate despite supply chain pressures from FEOC and tariffs.\nExecutives may focus on near-term deployment to capture safe-harbor credits while embedding flexibility through digital tools, artificial intelligence, and resilient supply chains.\nRead more from the collection\n2026 Energy, Resources, and Industrials Outlooks\nThis 2026 outlook highlights five key trends shaping the year ahead, along with associated risks and opportunities, and actionable strategies.\nPolicy shifts: Adapting to a changing energy landscape\nStorage integration: Delivering clean, firm power on demand\nCapital and operational efficiency: Implementing a leaner, smarter strategy\nStrategic merger and acquisition: Attracting capital through platform and mature assets\nSupply chain agility: Prioritizing alternative sourcing and reshoring\nTable of contents\nA changing energy landscape\nStorage integration\nCapital and operational efficiency\nStrategic M&A\nSupply chain agility\nThe year ahead\nShare Infographic\nShare\nlinkedin\ntwitter\nfacebook\nOr copy link\nCopy\n1. Policy shifts: Adapting to a changing energy landscape\nPolicy changes in 2025 may worsen compressed timelines and raise costs, reshaping renewable economics. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) shortened qualification windows for wind and solar credits, while new guidance from the Internal Revenue Service requires continuous construction.\n4\nFEOC restrictions further raise supply chain pressures, making developers weigh credit value against compliance costs.\nThese shifts also create additional clarity through 2030.\n5\nDeloitte analysis projects that annual solar, wind, and storage additions between 2026 and 2030 could fall to a range of 30 GW to 66 GW, down from a range of 54 GW to 85 GW under pre-OBBBA trajectories (figure 1).\n6\nShare Infographic\nShare\nlinkedin\ntwitter\nfacebook\nOr copy link\nCopy\nCompressed timelines and shifting economics\nWind and solar developers are accelerating projects to secure safe-harbor eligibility.\n7\nPre-2026 starts\n: Projects that begin construction by Dec. 31, 2025, may still qualify for tax credits without being subject to the new FEOC restrictions and have four years to be placed in service, potentially preserving credits with supply flexibility.\n8\nMid-2026 starts\n: Projects beginning construction by July 4, 2026, or in service by 2027, may still qualify but face uncertainty around FEOC compliance.\nBeyond utility-scale wind and solar, phaseouts are reshaping other technologies. The residential solar 25D credit sunsets after 2025, pushing installers toward leasing, power purchase agreements (PPAs), and cooperatives, while storage, hydro, and geothermal retain longer credit windows into the 2030s.\n9\nPhaseouts alone could increase solar costs by 36% to 55%\nover the next year\nand onshore wind by 32% to 63%, but data center demand and rising electricity prices reinforce renewable viability.\n10\nFixed-mount solar already outcompetes natural gas combined cycle in many regions without credits.\n11\nProject and trade headwinds\nThe Department of the Interior paused offshore wind leasing, removed designated areas, and halted projects.\n12\nFunding reductions across agencies are impacting siting and financing,\n13\nwhile\nthe Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed repeal of the endangerment finding and fossil plant emissions standards could further weaken renewable demand.\nTrade investigations are compounding costs. Antidumping and countervailing duties investigations are targeting solar and battery inputs, while Section 232 probes could extend exposure to wind and electrical components.\n14\nStates as swing factors\nIn 2024, 28 states with renewable portfolio standards (RPS) drove 37% of renewable additions.\n15\nYet momentum is uneven: Ohio is sunsetting its RPS after 2026, while North Carolina rolled back its 2030 carbon reduction target, both citing affordability concerns.\n16\nMore states could revisit commitments under economic pressure. Permitting and long-term targets remain critical levers, but local opposition and interconnection queues still pose barriers.\n17\nIn 2026\n, developers are working toward front-loading construction to secure safe-harbor eligibility and four-year flexibility, diversifying suppliers and investing domestically to manage FEOC and tariffs, and siting projects where market drivers, RPS support, and permitting clarity sustain deployment. Supply chain and workforce challenges persist, underscoring the new playbook: build fast, stay flexible, and invest in resilience.\n2. Storage integration: Delivering clean, firm power on demand\nHyperscalers are driving unprecedented demand for firm, low-carbon power.\n18\nThe United States hosts 90% of hyperscalers’ global carbon-free energy contracts, with renewables supplying 78% and nuclear providing the rest.\n19\nBattery storage is the fastest bridge to 24/7 clean power, as clean baseload options like nuclear, hydro, enhanced geothermal, and natural gas with carbon capture take years to develop.\n20\nHyperscaler demand accelerates solar-plus-storage\nBy October 2025, US operating storage capacity reached 37.4 GW, up 32% year to date. Another 19 GW is under construction through 2026, with a 187 GW pipeline by 2030.\n21\nOver half of the utility-scale storage coming online by 2026 is paired with solar, concentrated in three southwestern states.\n22\nSome data centers are exploring on-site or co-located gas, nuclear, and solar-plus-storage as a way to avoid interconnection queues.\n23\nSome hyperscalers are absorbing post-OBBBA renewable PPA price hikes of 4%, supporting solar-plus-storage growth. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) and the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) remain strong PPA markets.\n24\nBusiness models and market signals\nStorage economics are shifting from ancillary services toward energy arbitrage and multi-contract models (figure 2), blending energy sales, capacity payments, and hedging instruments to stabilize returns.\n25\nIn SPP, 10 GW of storage could avoid US$2.2 billion in system costs over the next decade.\n26\nMarket reforms are reinforcing storage momentum: ERCOT introduced new reliability services, PJM updated interconnection rules, and New York launched bulk energy storage credit programs.\n27\nShare Infographic\nShare\nlinkedin\ntwitter\nfacebook\nOr copy link\nCopy\nStorage diversifies and scales\nTechnology and market innovation are broadening storage’s role.\nTechnology innovation:\nLithium iron phosphate batteries are displacing nickel manganese cobalt lithium-ion batteries for cost and safety reasons. Long-duration pilots include 48-hour hydrogen-lithium hybrids and 100-hour iron-air batteries.\n28\nDistributed growth\n: Distributed storage has grown fivefold since 2020 to 4.8 GW in 2024, with another 4 GW expected by 2026.\n29\nVirtual power plant enrollment—aggregated distributed energy resources (DERs) like batteries, solar, and electric vehicles coordinated to act as a single resource—reached 30 GW in 2024. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Order 2222 is expected to accelerate aggregated DER participation in wholesale markets.\n30\nIn 2026\n, developers are likely to accelerate solar-plus-storage to serve",

We\nwon’t get there\nin 2026. In fact, scientists have been working toward that goal since\nat least the 1980s\n, and it has proved difficult, to say the least.\n“If someone says\nquantum computers\nare commercially useful today, I say I want to have what they’re having,” said\nYuval Boger\n, chief commercial officer of the quantum-computing startup\nQuEra\n,\non stage at the\nQ+AI\nconference in\nNew York City\nin October.\nThis article is part of our special report\nTop Tech 2026\n.\nBecause the goal is so lofty, tracking its progress has also been difficult. To help chart a course toward truly transformative quantum technology and mark milestones along the path, the team at\nMicrosoft Quantum\nhas come up with a new\nframework\n.\nThis framework lays out three levels of quantum-computing progress. The first level includes the kinds of machines we have today: the so-called noisy, intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. These computers are made up of roughly 1,000 quantum bits, or\nqubits\n, but are noisy and error prone. The second level consists of small machines that implement\none of many protocols that can robustly\ndetect and correct qubit errors\n. The third and final level represents a large-scale version of those error-corrected machines, containing hundreds of thousands or even millions of qubits and capable of millions of quantum operations, with high fidelity.\nIf you accept this framework, 2026 is slated to be the year when customers can finally get their hands on level-two quantum computers. “We feel very excited about the year 2026, because lots of work that happened over the last so many years is coming to fruition now,” says\nSrinivas Prasad Sugasani\n, vice president of quantum at Microsoft.\nMicrosoft, in collaboration with the startup\nAtom Computing\n, plans to\ndeliver\nan error-corrected quantum computer to the Export and Investment Fund of\nDenmark\nand the\nNovo Nordisk Foundation\n. “This machine should be utilized toward establishing a scientific advantage—not a commercial advantage yet, but that’s the path forward,” Sugasani says.\nQuEra\nhas also\ndelivered\na quantum machine ready for error correction to Japan’s\nNational Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST)\n, and plans to make it available to global customers in 2026.\nThe significance of error correction\nArguably, the main trouble with today’s quantum computers is their propensity for noise. Quantum bits are inherently fragile and thus sensitive to all kinds of environmental factors, such as electric or\nmagnetic fields\n, mechanical vibrations, or even\ncosmic rays\n. Some have argued that even noisy quantum machines can be useful, but almost everyone agrees that for truly transformative applications, quantum computers will need to become error resilient.\nTo make classical information robust against errors, one can simply repeat it. Say you want to send a 0 bit along a noisy channel. That 0 might get flipped to a 1 along the way, causing a miscommunication. But if you instead send three zeros in a row, it will still be obvious that you were trying to send a 0 even if one gets flipped.\nSimple repetition does not work with qubits, because they cannot be copied and pasted. But there are still ways to encode the information contained in a single qubit onto many physical qubits, making it more resilient. These groups of physical qubits encoding one qubit’s worth of information are known as\nlogical qubits\n. Once information is encoded in these logical qubits, as the computation proceeds and errors occur, error-correction\nalgorithms\ncan then tease apart what mistakes were made and what the original information was.\nJust creating these logical qubits is not enough—it’s important to experimentally verify that encoding information in logical qubits leads to lower error rates and better computation. Back in 2023, the team at QuEra, in collaboration with researchers at\nHarvard\n,\nMIT\n, and the University of\nMaryland\n,\nshowed\nthat quantum operations carried out with logical qubits outperformed those done with bare physical qubits. The Microsoft and Atom Computing team\nmanaged the same feat\nin 2024.\nThis year, these scientific advances will reach customers. The machine that Microsoft and Atom Computing will be delivering, called Magne, will have 50 logical qubits, built from some 1,200 physical qubits, and should be operational by the start of 2027. QuEra’s machine at AIST has around 37 logical qubits (depending on implementation) and 260 physical qubits, Boger says.\nQuantum computers made of atoms\nIt may be no coincidence that both of the level-two quantum computers will be built out of the same types of qubits: neutral atoms. While the classical computing world has long since settled on the\ntransistor\nas the fundamental device of choice, the quantum-computing world has yet to pick the perfect qubit, be it a\nsuperconductor\n(pursued at\nIBM\n,\nGoogle\n, and others), a photon (used by the likes of\nPsiQuantum\nand\nXanadu\n), an ion (developed by\nIonQ\nand\nQuantinuum\n, to name a few), or other.\nAll of these options have their advantages and disadvantages, but there is a reason some of the earliest error-corrected machines are built with neutral atoms. The physical qubits that make up a logical qubit need to be close to each other, or connected in some way, in order to share information. Unlike, say,\nsuperconducting qubits\nprinted on a chip, any two atomic qubits can be brought right next to each other (an advantage shared by\ntrapped ions\n).\n“Neutral atoms can be moved around,” says QuEra’s Boger. “That allows us to build error-correction methods that are just not possible with static qubits.”\nA neutral-atom quantum computer consists of a vacuum chamber. Inside the chamber, a gas of atoms is cooled to just above absolute zero. Then, individual atoms are captured, held, and even moved around by tightly focused laser beams in a technique known as\noptical tweezing\n. Each atom is a single physical qubit, and these qubits can be arranged in a 2D or even 3D array.\nNeutral-atom quantum computers consist of individual atoms that are manipulated and controlled primarily by\nlasers\n. Complex optical setups guide the laser beams to their precise destinations.\nAtom Computing\nThe computation itself—the sequence of “quantum gates”—is performed by shining a separate laser at the atoms, illuminating them in a precisely orchestrated fashion. In addition to maneuverability, the neutral-atom approach offers parallelism: The same laser pulse can illuminate many pairs of atoms at once, performing the same operation on each pair simultaneously.\nThe main downside of neutral-atom qubits is they are a bit slow. Computations on atomic systems are about one-hundredth to one-thousandth as fast as their\nsuperconducting\ncounterparts, says\nJerry Chow\n, director of quantum systems at IBM Quantum.\nHowever, Boger argues that this slowdown can be compensated for. “Because of the unique capabilities of neutral atoms, we have shown that we can create a 50x or 100x speedup over what previously was thought,” he says, referring to\nrecent work\nat QuEra in collaboration with Harvard and\nYale\n. “We think that when you compare what some people call time to solution, not just clock speed but how long it would take you to get to that useful result…that neutral atoms today are comparable to superconducting qubits.” Even though each operation is slow, more operations are done in parallel and fewer operations are needed for error correction, allowing for the speedup.\nMore than one way to skin Schrödinger’s cat\nMicrosoft’s three-level framing is not accepted by everyone in the industry.\n“I think that kind of level framing…is a very physics-device-oriented view of the world, and we should be looking at it more from a computational view of the world, which is, what can you actually use these circuits for and enable?” says IBM’s Chow.\nChow argues that, although a large error-corrected machine is the ultimate goal, it doesn’t mean error correction must be implemented first. Instead, the team at IBM is focusing on finding use cases for existing machines and using other error-suppressing strategies along the way, while also working toward a fully error-corrected machine in\n2029\n.\nWhether or not you accept the framing, the teams at QuEra, Microsoft, and Atom Computing are optimistic about the neutral-atom approach’s potential to reach large-scale devices. “If there’s one word, it’s scalability. That’s the key benefit of neutral atoms,” says\nJustin Ging\n, chief product officer at Atom Computing.\nBoth the teams at QuEra and Atom Computing say they expect to be able to put 100,000 atoms into a single vacuum chamber within the next few years, setting a clear path toward that third level of\nquantum computing\n.\nThis article appears in the January 2026 print issue.\nFrom Your Site Articles\nLarge Number of Atoms Trapped In an Array Bolsters Quantum Computing ›\nQuantum Computing: Atomic Clocks Make for Longer-Lasting Qubits ›\nRelated Articles Around the Web\nThe Best Qubits for Quantum Computing Might Just Be Atoms ... ›\nBuildin",

        "original_content": "6 January 2026 - The global economy showed notable resilience in 2025, performing better than anticipated despite repeated shocks and heightened uncertainty. Trade flows continued to expand, and overall activity held up more strongly than many expected. The key question now is whether this resilience will persist into 2026. The\nWorld Economic Situation and Prospects 2026\nreport — to be released on 8 January 2026 — offers some early answers. Here are five main points to know:\n1.\nGlobal economic growth remains stable but subdued\n. The world economy is projected to grow at a modest pace. Subdued investment, high debt burdens, and limited fiscal space continue to constrain countries’ capacity to boost productivity and achieve stronger, sustained growth. Geopolitical tensions and financial risks add to these pressures, leaving the global outlook fragile.\n2.\nExpansion is steady but uneven across countries\n. Developed economies are projected to maintain broadly stable yet moderate growth. Several large developing economies are expected to sustain growth momentum, supported by resilient domestic demand or targeted policies. For vulnerable countries, however, the outlook remains challenging, as limited economic diversification, climate-related shocks, and high debt levels continue to weigh on prospects.\n3.\nTrade tensions have intensified but global impacts remain contained\n. A sharp increase in United States tariffs in 2025 introduced new trade frictions and unsettled the global trade environment. However, overall disruption to trade flows has thus far been limited. Bilateral deals between the United States and key trading partners helped prevent a broader escalation of tensions. Front-loaded shipments boosted activity early in the year, but this temporary momentum is expected to fade in 2026.\n4.\nGlobal inflation is cooling, though risks are still present\n. Disinflation is likely to continue through 2026, allowing central banks to gradually ease monetary conditions. However, potential supply‑side shocks— stemming from conflicts, geopolitical tensions, trade disruptions or climate‑related events — could still reignite inflationary pressures.\n5.\nArtificial intelligence offers promise for productivity, but uncertainty remains\n. Advances in artificial intelligence could boost productivity growth, but the scale and timing of gains remain highly uncertain. Benefits are likely to be unevenly distributed, possibly deepening existing inequalities. While AI is already enhancing efficiency and innovation in some sectors, its broader impact will depend on investments in skills, digital infrastructure, and policies that enable inclusive and responsible adoption.\nFollow the launch live on 8 January 2026 at 12:45 pm EST via\nUN Web TV\nand access the complete report and all the latest data on\nUN DESA’s website\n.",

This year's report was published on 5 January 2026.\nDownload Full Report\nOverview\n2026 is a tipping point year.\nIt's a time of great geopolitical uncertainty. Not because there's imminent conflict between the two biggest powers, the United States and China—that isn't even a top risk, it's a red herring this year. There's not (yet, at least) a second Cold War, with a rising China remaking the global system to its own liking, the Americans and allies resisting. Nor do tensions between the United States and Russia threaten to spiral out of control despite a war raging in Europe, the result of Vladimir Putin's longstanding grievances against the US-led order.\nThe United States is itself unwinding its own global order. The world's most powerful country is in the throes of a political revolution.\nRisk 1: US political revolution\nTrump is attempting to dismantle checks on his power, capture the machinery of government, and weaponize it against his enemies, making the United States the principal source of global risk in 2026.\nRead the risk\nRisk 2: Overpowered\nChina is betting on electrons. The United States is betting on molecules. This year, we’ll start to see who was right.\nRead the risk\nRisk 3: The Donroe Doctrine\nThe Trump administration doesn’t want to be the world's policeman but intends to assert direct control over America’s own backyard.\nRead the risk\nRisk 4: Europe under siege\nEurope's political center is collapsing in all three major powers at once, leaving the continent unable to fill the security vacuum left by America's retreat.\nRead the risk\nRisk 5: Russia's second front\nThe most dangerous front in Europe will shift from the trenches in Donetsk to the hybrid war between Russia and NATO.\nRead the risk\nRisk 6: State capitalism with American characteristics\nThe most economically interventionist American administration since the New Deal will pick winners and losers at a scale not seen in modern US history.\nRead the risk\nRisk 7: China's deflation trap\nBeijing won’t break out of its deflationary trap this year; instead, it will keep trying to export its way out, flooding global markets with cheap goods at everyone else’s expense.\nRead the risk\nRisk 8: AI eats its users\nUnder pressure to generate revenue and justify sky-high valuations, some AI companies will adopt extractive business models that threaten social and political stability.\nRead the risk\nRisk 9: Zombie USMCA\nNorth American trade will be stuck in limbo as USMCA staggers on, neither dead nor alive.\nRead the risk\nRisk 10: The water weapon\nWater is becoming a loaded weapon in several of the world's most dangerous rivalries.\nRead the risk\nRed Herrings\n'Tariff Man’ at large.

        "original_content": "Article\nCurrent political and economic issues succinctly explained.\nAffordability, Agreements, and Action by Congress\nInu Manak is senior fellow for trade policy.\nDespite the flurry of trade policy activity in 2025, President Donald Trump’s on-again, off-again tariff threats left the trade landscape largely intact. Tariffs are not nearly as high as anticipated, and firms took proactive measures to massively front-load the economy, delaying some tariff impacts. The year ahead is likely to be another roller coaster, but there are three trends in trade to keep a close eye on: the erosion of trade agreements, the effects of tariffs on affordability, and the potential limits of executive power in trade.\nMore on:\nGreenberg Center for Geoeconomic Studies\nTrade and Investment\nThe United States is charting a new course on trade, but it is casting aside fundamental rules that have underpinned the global trading system in the process. That is pushing some of its closest allies away and could further fragment trade rules. The Trump administration has signed a handful of new trade deals and is likely to increase pressure on trading partners next year to make those deals deliver (or walk away from them if they do not). Closer to home, if Trump rips up the deal with Canada and Mexico that he negotiated in his first term, it will send shock waves throughout the U.S. economy.\nThe World This Week\nCFR President\nMike Froman\nanalyzes the most important foreign policy story of the week.

The administration has exempted a range of household goods from tariffs, including bananas, beef, and coffee. If everyday items feel unaffordable, the administration could be pushed to respond with additional tariff relief.\nThroughout U.S. history, every major tariff increase was legislated by Congress. Today, Congress has virtually no role. This is a precarious state of affairs, because it means that trade policy is now beholden to whoever holds the White House—and in this case, trade policy is being made by one person. With the Supreme Court set to rule on Trump’s use of emergency tariffs early this year, we will soon find out if there are any limits to the president’s trade powers.\nFollowing the Money From Oil to Tech\nEdward Alden is senior fellow at CFR, specializing in U.S. economic competitiveness, trade, and immigration policy.\nHere is a rule for anticipating U.S. trade actions in 2026: follow the money. Despite promising tariff protections to revitalize American manufacturing, the Trump administration has selectively spared the wealthiest industries in the United States, from big tech to big oil.\nMore on:\nGreenberg Center for Geoeconomic Studies\nTrade and Investment\nTech companies avoided the worst tariffs—\nsemiconductors and smart phones\nwere exempted—and even benefited as the administration\neased export controls on China\nand knocked down\nCanada’s digital services tax\n. Europe will be the main target in 2026: the Trump administration\nwants a rollback\nof the European Union’s Digital Services Act and artificial intelligence regulations.\nConventional energy has also remained largely tariff-free, and new trade deals have included\npurchase commitments\nfor U.S. natural gas and oil. More is likely, especially if\nVenezuelan oil is reopened\nto U.S. producers.\nNone of that bodes well for the biggest trade negotiation of 2026: the\nreview of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement\n. The sectors at stake, especially\nautos\nand\nagriculture\n, have been the most harmed by the Trump actions to date. This year could be the death knell for three decades of free trade in North America.\nWill Trade Policies Drop Drug Prices?\nThomas Bollyky is senior fellow for international economics, law, and development and director of the Global Health Program. Elena Every is research associate for Global Health, Economics, and Development. Chloe Searchinger is former research associate for Global Health, Economics, and Development.\nIn 2025, President Trump broke\nnew ground\nby using trade tools in an effort to lower prescription drug prices at home, raise them abroad, and return drug manufacturing to the United States.\nThe tactic resulted in deals with foreign governments and pledges from drug manufacturers and alike, but the details and text of most of those commitments have not been released. The agreements with manufacturers are voluntary.\nIn 2026, we will be watching whether those trade deals generate real returns by lowering the sky-high costs that Americans pay for medicines and by reversing the U.S. pharmaceutical trade deficit, which has\ngrown\n9 percent annually over the last two decades—hitting record\nhighs\nin 2025.\nIt may take a while. In exchange for a three-year reprieve from U.S.\ntariffs\n,\nfourteen drugmakers\nagreed to lower their Medicaid drug prices, launch future drugs at prices comparable to those in other countries, and invest over\n$480 billion\nin U.S. manufacturing. Yet,\nour analysis\nof earning statements of companies that produce specialized pharmaceutical manufacturing equipment suggests that those drugmakers have not begun acquiring the means yet to launch new production facilities in the United States.\nIn December, the United Kingdom\nagreed in principle\nto raise by 25 percent its cost-effectiveness threshold for medicines procurement that the UK’s National Health Service uses, although it is unclear whether that will result in the UK spending more and U.S. patients paying less for prescription drugs. The UK government\nreported\nthat the cost allocations for the change had already been made earlier in 2025 and would not affect “frontline services.”\nIs the United States Still Committed to Slowing China’s AI Progress?\nChris McGuire is senior fellow for China and emerging technologies.\nThe United States’ approach to export controls on technology to China in 2026 could dictate whether the United States maintains its lead over China in artificial intelligence (AI) or whether China approaches parity.\nUntil 2025, export controls were the most important and most heavily used policy tool for slowing China’s technological progress in advanced technologies, particularly chip-making and AI. China has achieved real progress in those areas, but substantially less than if U.S. export controls had not been in place. Restrictions on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment (SME) have caused China’s advanced chip-making capabilities to\nsignificantly lag\nthose of U.S. allies and partners in both quantity and quality, and restrictions on the export of AI chips have caused China’s AI models to lag U.S. models by at least\nseven months\n. Those controls have been imperfect, but effective.\nThe Trump administration has not effected a single regulation tightening export controls on China, however. It has done nothing to tighten controls on SME exports, which were strengthened annually by the Biden administration, and has substantially loosened restrictions on AI chip exports to China. Meanwhile, China’s circumvention efforts grow by the day.\nIf the U.S. export control regime on advanced technologies is not actively maintained, it will atrophy. That would risk allowing China to catch up at the worst possible moment: just as those advanced technologies are emerging as major drivers of U.S. economic growth and military modernization.\nCreative Commons\nCreative Commons: Some rights reserved.\nClose\nThis work is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) License.\nView License Detail\nClose",

Just think about how AI, economic instability, global conflict, and shifting employee expectations have reshaped the workplace in just the past year. For HR and Benefits leaders, staying ahead of these trends isn’t just about planning—it’s about protecting the mental health and resilience of your workforce.\nSo what should you be preparing for in 2026? We asked a handful of Spring Health leaders and our LinkedIn community one question:\nWhat is one mental health issue that 2026 will be defined by, and how can HR and benefits leaders get in front of it?\nHere are eight themes that stood out, along with data and practical steps to help you plan ahead.\n1. Always-on care that meets our always-on reality\nThe prediction:\n“Continuous Care will be the new standard. Patients and payers will expect it. Providers will adopt technology platforms that enable it.”\n- April Koh, CEO and Co-Founder, Spring Health\nWhy it matters:\nThe days of isolated therapy sessions are ending. In 2026, employees will expect mental health support that extends across their care journey—not just in a single 50-minute session. This\n“Continuous Care”\nmodel will become table stakes for driving real outcomes and retention.\nKey stat:\n28.2% of U.S. adults\nwith a mental illness reported they did not receive the treatment they needed\nHow to get in front of it:\nAudit your current mental health solutions for between-session support\nPrioritize solutions that offer digital nudges, coaching tools, and self-help content\nFocus on sustained engagement, not just point-in-time access\nReposition mental health benefits as a proactive, ongoing experience\n2. The integration of AI in mental health\nThe prediction:\n“In 2026, employees will increasingly use general-purpose AI tools for mental health support, which will create serious risks around privacy, confidentiality, and misuse.”\n- Gijo Mathew, Chief Product Officer, Spring Health\nWhy it matters:\nGenerative AI tools are increasingly being used “off-label” by employees for emotional support. While convenient, this trend introduces serious risks around data privacy, misinformation, and clinical safety.\nKey stats:\n48.7% of U.S. adults\nhave used LLMs for psychological support in the last year\nOnly 18.5% of AI use\nfor mental health happens on tools built for mental health\nHow to get in front of it:\nDefine approved AI tools in your benefits program\nEducate employees on the risks of DIY mental health AI\nProvide a proven, enhanced EAP\nthat drives lasting outcomes\nChoose partners with clinically validated, privacy-first AI tools\nAsk mental health solutions how they combine AI with real human care\n3. How AI is reshaping employee stress and anxiety\nThe prediction:\n“AI isn’t only reshaping how we work. It’s reshaping how people think about their future. If we don’t get ahead of this, AI anxiety will become one of the biggest sources of workplace stress by 2026. Leaders need to treat this like a real people issue, not just a technology trend.”\n– Kelsey Witmer, Vice President, Total Rewards & People Operations, Spring Health\nWhy it matters:\nAI is no longer a distant future state. From automation of tasks to AI-assisted decision-making, employees are living through rapid change with unclear rules and mixed messaging. Many worry about job security, ethical use of AI, and whether they can keep up with shifting expectations.\nKey stats:\n72% of U.S. adults worry\nabout the economic effects of AI\n47% of U.S. adults worry\nabout their job security because of AI\nHow to get in front of it:\nAcknowledge AI-related anxiety and create space to talk about it openly.\nOffer AI “101” training so employees understand what’s changing and why.\nShow how AI can reduce workload and burnout, not just increase output.\nSet clear guardrails and direct employees to clinically validated tools for support.\n4. Cost containment without compromising mental health\nThe prediction:\n“In 2026, cost pressure won’t just push employers to cut. It will push them to be sharper. The winners will be the ones who shift spend into high-quality mental health solutions that can actually prove impact. Customers are looking for full-spectrum support.” –\nDan Harrah, Vice President, Clinical Sales, Spring Health\nWhy it matters:\nHealth care costs are climbing fast, and mental health is now one of the top contributors to overall spend. Employers are being forced to scrutinize every line item while still trying to offer competitive, human-centered benefits. The risk is dialing back support just as employee needs intensify. The opportunity is to treat mental health as\na strategic cost-containment lever\nby investing in solutions that deliver measurable outcomes—not just more volume.\nKey stats:\nEmployers are projecting\naround a 10% increase\nin overall healthcare costs for 2026.\nPharmacy costs are expected to grow even faster,\noften in the 11–12% range\n.\nHow to get in front of it:\nExpect ROI\nfrom your mental health solution, and\nseek guarantees of it\n.\nPrioritize solutions that show impact on total cost of care, not just utilization.\nUse tiered or center-of-excellence designs to steer members to high-quality care.\nAlign with finance on shared metrics: trend, risk reduction, and ROI.\n5. The rise of mental health–related leave\nThe prediction:\n“I think 2026 will be defined by a continued rise in mental health–related leaves—and by whether employers can build programs that truly help people get better and return to work safely.”\n– Kelsey Witmer, Vice President, Total Rewards & People Operations, Spring Health\nWhy it matters:\nLeaves of absence tied to mental health have been climbing for several years and are no longer rare exceptions. As workloads intensify and employees become more informed about their rights and options, more people are stepping away from work to cope with anxiety, depression, and burnout. HR teams are walking a fine line: if programs feel too restrictive, they look uncaring; if they’re overly generous but not outcomes-focused, they can compromise operations and still fail to help employees recover.\nKey stats:\n74% of employers report\nan increase in employee requests for leaves of absence or accommodations for mental health-related issues over the last year\n22% of employers say\nthey have changed their related accommodation or leave policies in response to this increase\nHow to get in front of it:\nSimplify and standardize the leave experience so employees, HR, and solutions aren’t navigating a fragmented process.\nUse integrated solutions that connect early risk identification, evaluation, care, and return-to-work support.\nTrack outcomes like time to recovery, repeat leaves, and administrative burden—not just days out of the office.\n6. Tackling burnout in all its forms\nThe prediction:\n“I think ‘quiet burnout’ will shape 2026—employees who appear engaged but are running on empty. It’s harder to detect than traditional burnout and often overlooked.”\n- Ashlyn B., customer success and implementation manager (via LinkedIn)\nWhy it matters:\nThe signs of\nemployee burnout\naren’t always obvious. More employees will begin masking emotional fatigue, presenting as productive while privately nearing collapse. Without clear signs like absenteeism or complaints, this “quiet burnout” will challenge HR leaders to detect distress before it becomes a crisis.\nKey stats:\n57% of employees say\nwork-related stress negatively impacts them\nAt least 50% of U.S. employees\nare “\nquiet quitting\n”\nHow to get in front of it:\nEquip managers to ask about energy, not just engagement\nUse anonymous pulse surveys to surface hidden burnout indicators\nPromote micro-rest practices and reframe PTO as recovery, not reward\nEncourage care-seeking behavior before a formal burnout diagnosis\n7. Politics and division drive anxiety\nThe prediction:\n“In the U.S. and around the world, mid-term elections, immigration enforcement, and threats to individual freedoms are among the topics that will drive anxiety in 2026 for employees.”\n- Dan Harrah, Vice President, Clinical Sales, Spring Health\nWhy it matters:\nSociopolitical stress is no longer just background noise—it’s a workplace issue. In a polarized election year in the U.S. and other countries, expect spikes in stress, interpersonal conflicts, and psychological strain among employees who are directly or indirectly impacted by government actions.\nKey stats:\n68% of U.S. adults say\nthe 2024 election was a significant source of stress\n56% of U.S. workers say\npolitical differences are a top contributor to incivility in the workplace\n70% of U.S. adults say\nthey don’t think people in the government care about them\nHow to get in front of it:\nCreate safe spaces:\nOffer manager training\nand clear discussion policies\nProvide flexibility around emotionally heavy news cycles (e.g., election week)\nCentralize resources for coping with uncertainty and civic stress\nMonitor team morale and adjust communication cadence during high-stress periods\nAcknowledge the situation and support leaders in naming what’s happening and being clear and honest on potential impact to employees\n8. Increasing support for neurodivergent employees\nThe prediction:\n“As we look toward 2026, I think the mental health issue that will demand the most attention is burnout 2.0 among neurodivergent employees. Many neurodivergent professionals (ADHD, autism, dyslexia, etc.) are navigating workplaces that weren’t designed with their needs in mind.”\n- Toni B., coach (via LinkedIn)\nWhy it matters:\nBurnout among\nneurodivergent employees\noften looks di",

It’s very real. And it has no easy answers. Greenland’s autonomy, its future, hangs in the balance.\nGreenland is a territory of Denmark. Since 2009, it’s been largely self-governing, and has the right to pursue independence at a time of its choosing. Independence is the wish of all its political parties. But with economic self-sufficiency some way off, it’s sticking with Denmark for now.\nNot if United States President Donald Trump has his way. He wants Greenland for the US. Since the bombing of Venezuela and the\nabduction of President Nicolas Maduro\n, realisation has dawned that he is deadly serious about this. The White House has pointedly\nrefused to take military force off\nthe table, although the real estate mogul-turned-president would likely prefer a simple cash deal.\nEurope is in diplomatic crisis mode. Denmark is a NATO member. The idea of NATO’s chief guarantor – the US – annexing territory from a member state seemed preposterous until recently. No longer.\nSo what can Denmark’s friends do to stop it?\nThe uncomfortable truth is that if Donald Trump sends in troops, Greenland would likely fall in days, perhaps hours. Trump has mocked Denmark’s forces there as “two dogsleds”. And though this doesn’t meet any truth test, his point holds. Greenland is sparsely defended. Denmark’s Joint Arctic Command in Greenland consists of a handful of warships and search and rescue teams.\nAdvertisement\nThe US, meanwhile, already has a major base in northwestern Greenland, under a 1951 pact that also allows Washington to set up more bases on the island. Nearly 650 personnel are stationed at the base, including US Air Force and Space Force members.\nCopenhagen is tooling up. It has announced $4.2bn in extra defence spending for the Arctic. And it is buying 16 more F-35 fighter jets (from, of course, the US). But even so, Denmark would have little chance against the full might of the US military.\nSo a diplomatic united front has been launched. As with other Trump-created crises, Europe’s leaders are adopting an approach that could be called transatlantic judo. Like judo wrestlers, they’re trying to redirect Trump’s energy – his strident, America First unilateralism – and persuade him that the best expression of this is collegiate, transatlantic multilaterism.\nEssentially, they’re saying, “Yes, Donald. You’re absolutely right to raise Arctic security as a big problem. We totally agree. While we’re not sure that invading Greenland is the answer, NATO is the solution.”\nWe’ve heard this message from NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte in recent days. And the British and German governments have both suggested NATO forces be deployed to Greenland to boost Arctic security. A German delegation was in Washington, DC, before Wednesday’s meeting between State Secretary Marco Rubio and the Danish and Greenlandic foreign ministers.\nWhile the Europeans try their judo, Donald Trump’s approach is more sumo. Wielding the great geopolitical heft of the US, the president is unyielding. To all entreaties from bewildered Europeans, he remains unmoved.\nWhen they say he can have all the US military presence on Greenland that he wants under the 1951 treaty with Denmark, he says he wants more. When they say a unilateral annexation of Greenland would be the end of NATO, he shrugs as if that might be a price worth paying. When they question his claims that Russia and China are poised to take over Greenland themselves, he just repeats them.\nAppeasement or capitulation is possible. If the Europeans were panicked enough, they could lean on Denmark to give Greenlanders the independence referendum that’s been talked about for years. If Greenlanders chose full sovereignty – as a majority ultimately want – Europe could claim Greenland’s fate wasn’t their problem any more. But we’re not in that place yet.\nFor now, European leaders are united behind Copenhagen and Nuuk. Denmark’s sovereignty is inviolable, they say. And\nGreenland is not for sale\n.\nAdvertisement\nWhat we could be inching towards is a fudge. Something that everyone can take as satisfactory-ish. Maybe a resource deal for US access to\nGreenland’s abundant deposits\nof metals and rare earth elements. And maybe a beefed-up US military presence. Enough for Trump to claim a win. And for Europe to breathe a sigh of relief that NATO still has a heartbeat.",

New year's resolution.\nStrategic Insights\nThe Energy Transition in 2026: 10 Trends to Watch\nShares\nThe Energy Transition in 2026: 10 Trends to Watch\nThis year should see more promising clean energy solutions reach maturity and set the stage for wider adoption.\nJanuary 6, 2026\nBy\nWill Atkinson\n,\nLaurens Speelman\n,\nChiara Gulli\n,\nJames Newcomb\nTechnological progress is rarely linear. From the automobile to the television to solar power, a process of “gradually, then suddenly” can be observed. This process traditionally follows five distinct phases (outlined in Exhibit 1). The good news when it comes to our clean energy future is that many promising solutions are reaching stages of maturity that bring them closer to widespread adoption across a wide array of sectors and geographies.\nExhibit 1.\nTen trends for 2026 along the 5 phases of technology adoption.\n1. Decision makers consider “soft energy paths” to meet growing electricity demand\nOctober is the 50\nth\nanniversary of “\nThe Road Not Taken\n”, a landmark article by RMI cofounder Amory Lovins. The article encapsulates “soft energy paths,” a strategy which combines quick renewable energy deployment with “a prompt and serious commitment to efficient use of energy.” Fifty years later, this idea is as relevant as ever — as a\nnew era of load growth\nrequires\nfast, flexible solutions\nto meet increased demand. This time, it’s especially important in the Global South, where rapid demand growth and scarce capital combine to make these strategies more compelling than ever before.\nEnergy efficiency\nis a critical first fuel. Compared to supply-side projects\n,\ndemand-side measures\ncan increase grid capacity at\nroughly half the cost and 5 to 10 times the speed\n. For the grid itself,\nalternative transmission technologies\ncan increase buildout\nseveral times faster and cheaper\nthan traditional transmission. Innovative supply solutions, from\nvirtual power plants\nto “\npower couples\n” for co-location, are also in the early adoption phase (phase 3).\n2. Clean energy supports affordability with the right policies and investments\nMeanwhile, wind and solar energy have entered phase 4 (system integration) and are set to continue growing. Countries such as Denmark have generated\n70 percent\nof their electricity from solar and wind, while rising renewables are taking a larger share of generation\nin much of the Global South\n.\nCombined with rapid electrification, this puts massive requirements on infrastructure and “supporting innovations” such as flexibility. The main challenges now lie in orchestrating the renewable technologies into a new energy system that can support electrification efficiently.\nNow, as electricity demand rises, rising costs are a major concern — including in the United States, where affordability played a key role in recent elections and\ncould do so again\nin November’s midterms. Thankfully,\nwe can slash energy costs and waste\nby upgrading home technologies, implementing the right\nmarket\nmechanisms\nand\npolicies\nto fix who pays, and accelerating investment in the “soft energy path” solutions above.\nGlobal trends are already showing what’s possible for clean energy affordability.\nAverage battery grid storage costs\nare more than 2 times lower than 2 years ago and more than 3 times lower than 3 years ago. In tandem, more than\n90 percent\nof new renewable energy projects are cheaper than fossil fuel alternatives, and\nnew renewables generation is now eclipsing total electricity demand growth\n. Leading experts\nexpect this trend to continue\nas renewables and storage rise up the S-curve of phase 4, accelerating the transition away from fossil fuels.\n3. Electric vehicle adoption enters a new phase with further action on key enablers\nIn the passenger transport sector, EVs have emerged as the ‘winning technology’ and are moving from niche markets (phase 3) to the mass market (phase 4). As such,\nadoption varies widely\n, but\nmore than 1 in 4 new cars\nglobally now have a plug, helping importing countries collectively save\nmore than a million barrels\nof oil per day.\nReaching scale will also come with infrastructure and supply chain bottlenecks that must be resolved. For example,\nthis new phase requires further work on the enabling environment\n, from manufacturing investment to preparations for the grid. Affordable purchase prices and charging options are also crucial. New\nresearch\n,\npolicies\n, and\ntools\ncan help accelerate charging stations to match EV growth while managing new electricity demand and improving\nbattery\ncircularity\n.\nIn addition, battery electric trucks are moving from pilots (phase 2) to niche markets (phase 3) with several models commercially available and others nearing commercialization. We expect continued rapid improvement of battery electric trucks in terms of cost and performance, alongside a need for scaling niche markets (through trucking corridors, for example).\n4. Aviation contrails see further awareness and action with new collaborations\nNew\npartnerships\nand\nexplainers\nhave highlighted the potential impact of aviation contrails — and\nthe opportunity\nto quickly cut 80 percent of their warming by just tweaking 2 percent of flights. Success would make contrail avoidance\nthe sector’s greatest near-term solution\nfor warming through 2050.\nEarly solutions are ready for pilots as they move from phase 1 to 2. Recently tested corporate accounting methods could make a major difference, if strong stakeholder collaboration continues.\nFurther action could come\nfrom the EU Emissions Trading System. A key step now will be to build the transparent data practices that can underpin future progress.\n5. Industrial cleantech is boosted by new policies and protocols\nIndustrial heat pump adoption is nearing mass market (from phase 3 to phase 4), as progress in the buildings sector helps heat pumps improve performance while cutting costs. This progress creates inroads into higher-temperature industry, enabling further opportunities for electrification in industry.\nHowever, many industrial solutions are still in phase 2 or early phase 3 — such as green hydrogen, where top-down market mechanisms can incentivize early adoption. In 2026, several related policy efforts can spark change across the world.\nFirst, industrial efficiency could be improved significantly. High-efficiency motors are mature (phase 5), but only account for one-quarter of industrial motors; technological improvements could\nsave more electricity globally\nthan the entirety of\ndemand from data centers\n. Other measures include facility design, flexibility, and smart manufacturing.\nBroader actions include the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, which is moving from reporting to action across several industrial sectors alongside new reporting requirements from the\nEU Methane Regulation\n. India’s carbon market is also preparing for compliance trading in the second half of 2026. And voluntary carbon markets will continue to build on the recently launched\nCarbon Data Open Protocol (CDOP)\n.\n6. Super pollutant solutions find increased visibility and new market mechanisms\nSimilar progress is helping to raise awareness across\nmethane\nand other non-CO\n2\nsuper pollutants\n. New\nfunder collaboratives\n,\naction roadmaps\n, and\npowerful data\nfrom Climate TRACE are starting to bring unprecedented visibility to\nground-level ozone\n, the air pollutant that also causes\nas much current warming\nas the global road transport sector.\nThough early-stage field-building remains, many solutions intersect with energy transition efforts that are well into phases 3 and 4 of deployment. Enabling conditions are catching up, from recent\nlandfill methane policies\nto\ncorporate credit purchases\nthat reach more sectors. If this progress continues, it can leverage a crucial opportunity to\ncut warming fast\n.\n7. Cooling solutions reach new readiness, from innovation to deployment\nFrom appliances to design innovations, cooling solutions are gaining ground.\nIndia is a crucial player\n, as a leader in\nrecent efficiency progress\nas well as cooling demand growth.\nTake super-efficient air conditioners, which have progressed from a phase 1 solution search (via the\nGlobal Cooling Prize\n) to a phase 2 proof of concept.\nNine months of field testing\nin India’s Palava City showed that the winning technologies can cut appliances’ costs, energy use, and strain on peak electricity demand by half or more.\nThis coming year can accelerate\nadoption by scaling proof points, building capacity among manufacturers, and taking other market activation steps across awareness, finance, and demand aggregation.\nPassive daytime radiative cooling (PDRC) is nearing a similar stage, with a\nrecent call\nto demonstrate performance in real-world pilots. The coming months could show which approaches can lead.\n8. New standards catalyze embodied carbon solutions\nAnother opportunity for buildings is to improve embodied carbon, which accounts for\nmore than one-tenth of global emissions\ntoday. In countries like India, where as much as 90 percent of 2050 floor space has yet to be built, there are immense benefits to\nbuilding right the first time\n.\nWith many approaches in phase 2 and 3, policy standards can help incentivize early adoption. The\nRESNET Standards\nin the US are one such example, with publication and training expected in early 2026.\n9. China’s upcoming Five-Year Plan has ripple effects across the world\nChina is the pivot nation\nin the global energy transition, and its recent cleantech exports are\nreshaping the international landscape\n. Thus, this spring’s release of the 15\nth\nFive-Year Plan will be closely watched. As emissions\nbegin to plateau and fall\n, but\nclimate pledges remain modest\n, how will the next plan approach different energy technologies?\nWith its clean energy buildout firmly in phase 4 (or 5) across key technologies, China is transitioning fast and looking to new markets for ",

KDI에 따르면 1000인 이상 사업체 근로자의 임금은 11~50인 사업체보다 30.49% 높았다. 김민섭 KDI 연구위원은 “오늘날 청년 세대가 중소기업을 마다하고 경쟁이 치열한 대기업 일자리를 추구하는 이유가 임금 격차”라고 말했다. 전문가들은 연공서열이 아니라 직무급, 성과급제 등 역량에 기반한 임금체계가 확산해야 한다고 말했다. 김 위원은 “임금체계 개편을 위해 성과를 객관적으로 측정하는 시스템부터 마련해야 한다”고 조언했다.",

This year the CCPI 2026 paints the same ambivalent picture already seen in previous editions. Ten years after the Paris Agreement, global per capita emissions are falling, renewable energies are growing massively, and more than one hundred countries now have their own climate targets for net-zero emissions. However, the pace is still too slow to meet the Paris climate targets.\nAs in previous years, the top three ranks remain vacant. Countries must accelerate climate action to align with the Paris Agreement’s temperature limit.\nDenmark\n(4th) remains the top-ranked country. It ranks highly in climate policy and is among the only three countries that achieve a very high rating in renewable energies, supported by its leadership in offshore energy. The\nUnited Kingdom\n(5th) follows, climbing one place compared to last year and showing that years of climate policy efforts are paying off.\nMorocco\n(6th) scores well across most categories, maintains very low per capita emissions, invests significantly in public transport and has adopted a respectable new climate target for 2035.\nAt the bottom of the ranking are\nSaudi Arabia\n(67th),\nIran\n(66th) and the\nUnited States\n(65th). The largest oil- and gas-producing countries show no sign of departing from fossil fuels as a business model and continue to miss the opportunity to embrace the future.\nG20 countries: Only one good, ten very weak\nThere is positive momentum for renewable energies and electrification worldwide. However, the picture among the major emitters is worrying. The G20 countries are responsible for more than 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions and have a special responsibility, yet only one G20 country, the United Kingdom, receives a high rating. Ten G20 countries continue to be classified as\nvery low performers\n, including\nTurkey, China, Australia, Japan, Argentina, Canada, Korea, Russia\n,\nthe USA and Saudi Arabia\n.

AI는 순식간에 기온 변화에 따른 개화 시기를 분석해냈다.\n기술은 확실히 훌륭하다. AI와 빅데이터 덕분에 우리는 방구석에서 지구 반대편을 실시간으로 본다. 하지만 이면에는 경험의 멸종이라는 우려가 있다. 자연과 부대끼고, 현장의 공기를 마시며 얻는 직관이 사라진다는 거다. 실제로 소리 데이터만 분석하던 한 연구자는 현장 검증 없이는 데이터의 진짜 의미를 파악할 수 없음을 깨닫고 다시 숲으로 향했다고 한다.\n어쩌면 이는 우리 모두의 이야기다. 편리함에 취해 '실내 인간'이 되어가지만, 검색으로 찾은 정보가 피부에 닿는 현실을 대체할 순 없다. AI 덕분에 더 똑똑해졌지만, 역설적으로 현장은 더 절실해졌다. 흙을 밟아야 숲이 보이고, 사람과 눈을 맞춰야 세상이 읽힌다. 좋은 기사를 위해 현장을 찾는 기자나 숲으로 향하는 생태학자의 마음은 같다.\n효율성만 따지면 장화를 신는 대신 마우스를 쥐는 게 합리적일지 모른다. 하지만 정답은 항상 검색창에만 있는 것이 아니다. 여전히 우리에게 필요한 건 안락한 의자에서 일어나 장화를 신고, 기꺼이 진흙탕을 내디디며 세상과 부딪힐 결심이다.\n[이새봄 기자]",

'트럼프 2.0'으로 불리는 두 번째 임기는 '왕의 귀환'이라 할 수 있을 만큼 철저히 준비된 상태에서, 그리고 매우 빠르고 직선적인 방식으로 시작됐다.\n트럼프는 의회를 설득하기보다 행정부 권한을 최대한 활용하는 길을 택했고, 속도는 그 자체로 정치적 메시지가 됐다. 그 결과 트럼프의 국정 운영은 다시 한번 논쟁의 중심에 섰지만, 동시에 분명한 사실 하나를 보여줬다. 그의 정치는 일시적 현상이 아니라, 미국 정치의 한 축으로 자리 잡은 '현실(Reality)'이라는 점이다. 지난 1년간 트럼프의 국정 운영이 어떻게 작동해왔는지 키워드로 정리해본다.\n'리셋' 다시 제자리로\n트럼프 2기의 첫해를 설명하는 첫 번째 키워드는 '리셋(reset)'이다. 지난 1년은 새로운 정책을 설계하거나 노선을 수정하는 과정이 아니었다. 마치 전임 조 바이든 정부의 4년이 없었던 것처럼, 국정 운영을 트럼프 1기와 연속선상으로 돌려놓는 것에 집중했다. 트럼프 2기의 리셋은 과거로의 단순한 회귀라기보다, 트럼프 정치가 정당하다고 믿는 기준을 다시 국정의 출발선에 세우려는 시도였다.\n이 같은 접근은 이민과 국경 정책에서 분명히 드러났다. 제도의 개선보다는 유입 차단과 통제가 앞섰고, 정책의 완성도를 높이기 위한 조율보다는, 문제 인식 자체를 트럼프 1기 시절의 틀로 되돌리는 데 초점이 맞춰졌다. 외교와 동맹 역시 이 흐름에서 벗어나지 않았다. 제도와 관례 대신 대통령 개인의 판단과 발언이 외교 신호로 작동했다. 동맹은 가치의 공유보다 비용과 기여의 문제로 재정의됐고, 외교의 중심은 다시 백악관으로 이동했다.\n행정명령으로 '속도전'\n트럼프 대통령은 2기 첫해(2025년 12월 23일 기준)에만 225개의 행정명령(Executive Orders)을 내리며 이례적 속도와 규모를 보여줬다. 트럼프 1기의 전체 행정명령 220개, 바이든 4년의 162개와 비교해보면 지난 1년 동안 트럼프 행정부가 얼마나 행정명령에 국정 수행을 의존했는지 알 수 있다.\n행정명령 중심의 통치는 대통령과 핵심 참모들의 판단이 정책 방향을 좌우하는 구조로 이어지며, 의회와의 조율보다는 집행의 속도를 우선하는 국정 운영 방식을 강화한다. 이는 국정 운영에서 대통령의 역할과 권한이 그만큼 확대됐음을 보여주는 대목이다.\n행정명령에 의존한 국정 운영은 사법부와 충돌이라는 구조적 한계에 부딪히기도 한다. 상호관세 관련 판결을 포함해 이민·관세·행정 권한을 둘러싼 행정명령 상당수는 합헌 여부를 두고 법원의 판단을 앞두고 있다. 다수의 행정명령은 트럼프 2기의 정책 방향을 분명하게 드러내지만, 불확실성 역시 함께 확대되고 있다.\n영원한 동맹은 없다 '아메리카 퍼스트'\n외교·무역·첨단기술 보호는 물론 이민 정책에 이르기까지 트럼프 2기를 관통하는 키워드는 여전히 '미국 우선주의(America First)'다. 중산층 붕괴와 소득 격차 심화 속에서 \"살기가 팍팍해졌다\"는 체감은 미국 사회 전반에 퍼져 있다. '미국을 다시 위대하게(Make America Great Again)'라는 구호가 강력한 정치적 동력이 된 배경도 여기에 있다. 트럼프는 그 원인을 미국 내부의 구조적 문제보다는 외부, 즉 다른 나라 탓으로 돌렸다.\n기후협약 재탈퇴부터 북대서양조약기구(NATO) 회원국과 동맹국에 대한 방위비 분담 압박, 상호관세 부과, 최근 발표된 국가안보전략보고서(NSS), 나아가 니콜라스 마두로 베네수엘라 대통령 체포 작전까지, 미국의 이익이라는 명분이 성립하는 한 도덕적 정당성이나 국제 규범은 부차적인 문제가 됐다.\nNSS를 요약하면 '달면 삼키고 쓰면 뱉겠다'는 식의 철저한 이해관계 중심의 접근이라는 평가도 있다. 바이든 행정부의 지난 4년은 표현과 화법은 달랐지만 핵심 외교·안보 전략에서 트럼프 1기의 정책을 상당 부분 계승했던 것이 사실이다. 미국이 세계의 정의를 이야기하던 시대는 저물었고, '다시 미국을 위대하게'란 구호는 이제 '뉴 노멀'로 자리 잡았다.\n능력보다 충성도가 먼저\n트럼프 2기 인사의 가장 중요한 기준은 '충성도(Loyalty)'다. 전문성이나 경력, 공화당 내 위상보다 트럼프 대통령 개인에 대한 충성 여부가 우선한다. 백악관과 주요 부처의 인선은 정치적 일관성과 메시지 통제를 중심으로 재편됐으며, 이는 국정 운영의 속도를 높이는 동시에 조직 안정성과 정책 지속성에 대한 우려를 낳고 있다.\n워싱턴 정가에서는 백악관 비서실장인 수지 와일스를 제외하면, 그 누구도 언제든 경질될 수 있다는 말이 공공연히 돌고 있다. 한국과의 관세협상 과정에서 강경한 태도를 보였던 하워드 러트닉 상무장관 역시 정책적 신념보다는 트럼프 대통령의 신임을 얻기 위해 성과를 보여주려 했다는 해석이 뒤따른다. 충성도를 중심으로 한 인선은 백악관 측근 그룹을 보면 잘 알 수 있다. 대표적인 인물로는 와일스를 비롯해 강경 이민·국경 정책의 상징적 인물인 스티븐 밀러, 보수 행정철학을 주도해온 러셀 보트가 거론된다. 외교·안보 라인에서는 마코 루비오 국무장관, 차세대 주자로 부상한 J D 밴스 부통령이 핵심 축을 이룬다.\n백악관 내부 메시지 관리와 대외 소통을 담당하는 인물들 역시 대부분 트럼프의 정치 노선을 적극적으로 대변해온 인사들이다. 오랜 기간 트럼프와 호흡을 맞춰온 댄 스커비노, 강경하고 직설적 화법으로 주목받는 대변인 캐럴라인 레빗, 그리고 선거 전략과 조직 관리에 깊이 관여해온 제임스 블레어 등이 그 예다.\n정치적 프레임이 된 '반이민'\n트럼프 2기의 이민(Immigration) 정책은 불법체류자 단속이나 비자 제도 조정의 문제가 아니라 이민을 통제의 문제로 재구성하는 정치적 프레임에 가깝다. 이민세관단속국(ICE)의 단속 강화는 법 집행을 넘어 '질서 회복'을 상징하는 메시지로 기능하고 있으며, 출생시민권 재검토 논의 역시 이민을 권리가 아닌 관리 대상으로 전환하려는 의지를 보여준다.\n취업 이민도 예외가 아니다. H-1B 비자를 비롯한 전문직 비자는 글로벌 경쟁력이나 기업 수요보다 '미국인 일자리 보호'라는 명분 아래 더 엄격한 관리 대상이 되고 있다. 조지아에서 벌어진 한국인 구금 사태는 대규모 투자를 한다고 하더라도 고용 구조나 비자 문제에서 벗어날 수 없음을 보여준다. 이는 반이민 정책이 산업과 투자 환경 전반에까지 영향을 미치고 있음을 보여준다.\n관세, 충격과 압박의 수단으로\n관세(Tariff)는 더 이상 산업 보호나 무역 불균형 조정을 위한 도구에 머물지 않는다. 관세는 미국이 세계와 관계를 맺는 방식 자체가 어떻게 변했는지를 보여주는 정치적 신호에 가깝다. 트럼프 2기에서 관세는 동맹과 우방을 가리지 않고 적용됐고, 조율과 합의보다 충격과 압박을 통해 결과를 만들어내려는 방식이 반복됐다. 방위비 분담, 안보 협력, 기술 규제 등 다른 현안들과 결합되면서 미국의 이익을 관철하기 위한 종합 패키지의 일부가 됐다. 관세 부과 자체보다 더 큰 문제는 예측 가능성의 상실이다. 관세가 협상 결과가 아니라 정치적 판단에 따라 언제든지 동원될 수 있다는 점에서, 기업과 정부 모두 중장기 전략을 세우기 어려운 환경에 놓이게 됐다.\n하지만 관세는 미국 국내 정치의 균열을 키우는 요인으로도 작용하고 있다. 중국과의 관세 갈등 여파로 불거진 대두(콩) 사태의 예처럼, 수출 감소와 가격 불안정은 농민들의 불만으로 이어졌고, 이는 공화당 지지 기반 내부에서도 관세 정책에 대한 회의론을 확산시키는 계기가 됐다. 동시에 소비재 전반의 가격 상승은 서민층의 체감 물가를 자극하고 있다. 관세가 외국 기업이 아니라 미국 소비자에게 전가되고 있다는 비판이 힘을 얻는 이유다.\n사법적 변수도 남아 있다. 관세 부과 권한의 범위를 둘러싼 소송이 상급 법원으로 이어지면서, 이르면 연초에 대법원의 판단이 나올 가능성이 거론된다. 이 판결은 대통령이 행정권을 통해 무역 정책을 어디까지 밀어붙일 수 있는지를 가르는 중요한 기준이 될 전망이다.\n젊은 보수와 MAGA의 '충돌'\n트럼프 2기의 국정 운영은 보수 진영 내부의 균열을 가져오고 있다. 특히 관세와 반이민 정책, 충성도 중심의 인사 기조는 젊은 보수층(Young Conservatives)과 전통적 마가(MAGA) 지지층 사이의 내부 균열을 드러냈다. 젊은 보수 유권자들에게 관세로 인한 물가 상승과 소비자 부담, 취업 비자 축소는 이념적 자부심보다 현실적 비용으로 다가온다.\n이 같은 긴장은 보수 진영의 대표적 젊은 목소리로 꼽혔던 고(故) 찰리 커크의 발언과 행보에서도 나타났다. MAGA 운동의 확산에 중요한 역할을 해온 그는 트럼프를 지지하면서도, 관세와 경제 정책이 젊은 세대의 기회와 성장 가능성을 훼손할 수 있다는 점에 대해 문제를 제기했다. 이는 트럼프 개인에 대한 충성보다는 보수 이념의 미래와 세대교체, 그리고 지지층의 외연 확장을 고민하는 젊은 보수층의 시각을 대변한다는 평가를 받는다.\n반면 기존 MAGA 지지층은 정책의 세밀한 조정이나 지지층 확장보다 명확하고 일관된 메시지 유지에 더 큰 가치를 둔다. 이들에게 중요한 것은 중도 확장이나 설득이 아니라, 핵심 지지층을 결집시키는 선명성이다. 결국 이는 단순한 노선 갈등이 아니라 보수 정치가 확장을 택할 것인가, 결집을 택할 것인가의 논쟁으로 이어지고 있다.\n[송원석 미주한인유권자연대(KAGC) 사무총장]",

Both committees must advance versions of the crypto market structure bill before a unified text can even reach the Senate floor.\nSenate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott (R-S.C.) has\npublicly\nset his sights on a markup, signaling an aggressive push to force resolution of issues that have previously stalled negotiations.\n“My understanding is that the chairman is going to have a vote, come hell or high water, on Thursday for the next week,” said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) in a statement.\nMeanwhile, the Agriculture Committee is expected to hold its own markup on the same day, a signal that leadership wants to synchronize both sides of the regulatory divide.\nAdvertisement: Scroll to Continue\nOfficially, neither committee has released a finalized legislative text ahead of their sessions, raising questions about whether members will vote on updated drafts or older placeholder language.\nRead more:\nCompliance Is Crypto’s New Cost of Doing Business\nLiquidity, Cash Management and the Stablecoin Question\nAt its core, the market structure legislation seeks to answer one foundational question: How should digital assets be regulated in the United States? Current law splits oversight between the SEC (for securities) and the CFTC (for commodities), but the rapid growth of tokenized markets, decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoins has blurred these categories in ways regulators never anticipated.\nIf both the Agriculture and Banking committees advance versions of the market structure bill that can be reconciled, the Senate could consider a formal floor vote within weeks. Should both chambers agree on identical language, the legislation would head to the president’s desk for signature.\nBut if committee members cannot agree, whether due to unresolved issues like DeFi liability, yield mechanics, or jurisdictional splits, the bill could stall or be substantially rewritten in subsequent months.\nFor pure crypto firms, the markup offers both peril and promise. A clear federal framework could unlock vast flows of institutional capital and legitimized market infrastructure. But heavy regulatory burdens could also impose compliance costs that favor larger incumbents over nimble startups.\nThe treatment of DeFi remains especially uncertain. Proponents argue that decentralized protocols offer efficiency, transparency, and competition to legacy systems. Skeptics within both regulatory agencies and financial institutions warn that DeFi’s code-driven models challenge core investor protection and market integrity norms.\nAnd while the signed-into-law GENIUS Act established baseline rules for stablecoins last year, a major regulatory flash point remains unresolved: whether crypto firms can offer yield-like rewards on stablecoin holdings. Traditional banks argue that such yield mechanisms siphon deposits from community banking markets and create unfair competition.\nCryptocurrency firms counter that yield incentives are essential to liquidity and user adoption, and that banning them outright would stifle innovation in DeFi and related markets. This standoff has emerged as one of the most potentially disruptive tradeoffs in the markup process.\nShould the bill include a strong prohibition on yield, it could appease banking interests but risk alienating segments of the crypto sector. Conversely, if markup language fails to address the issue robustly, opposition from banking lobbies may make bipartisan consensus harder to reach.\nRead also:\nConditional Charters Pull Crypto Closer to Core of US Banking\nWhy Crypto Market Structure Matters to Finance Teams\nFor years, cryptocurrency exposure at most large companies has been either tactical (payments experiments, pilot programs) or passive (holding digital assets received through operations). Regulatory uncertainty especially around custody, asset classification, and counterparty risk has made anything more ambitious difficult to justify to boards and auditors.\nFor chief financial officers (CFOs) and treasury leaders, the legislation under review could redefine how companies manage liquidity, deploy cash, hedge risk and interact with financial infrastructure over the next decade.\nThe market structure bill would establish registration regimes and compliance standards for digital asset intermediaries, potentially bringing crypto custody closer to the regulatory expectations CFOs already apply to banks, brokers and clearinghouses.\nGoldman Sachs\n, for example,\nreportedly\nsees more cryptocurrency adoption happening as regulations improve and new usages emerge.\nFor finance leaders, the key issue is predictability. Treasury teams need to know which rules apply before committing resources, integrating systems, or approving new financial instruments. Fragmented oversight increases compliance risk and discourages adoption.\nRecommended\nSenate Sets Dueling January Markups for High-Stakes Crypto Market Regulation\nAllianz Taps Anthropic to Help Deploy AI Throughout Its Insurance Business\nRain Raises $250 Million to Scale Platform for Launching Stablecoin Cards\nOnline Finally Breaks Brick and Mortar\nSee More In:\nB2B\n,\nB2B Payments\n,\nCFTC\n,\nCryptocurrency\n,\nFeatured News\n,\nLegislation\n,\nNews\n,\nPYMNTS News\n,\nregulations\n,\nSEC",

Thus, the purpose of the Preventive Priorities Survey (PPS) is not just to alert busy U.S. policymakers to incipient sources of instability over the next twelve months but also to help them decide which are most pressing.\nThe need for U.S. policymakers to look ahead and actively lessen conflict-related risks grows every year. The world has undeniably become more violent and disorderly. Indeed, the number of armed conflicts is now at its highest since the end of World War II. An increasing proportion of those, moreover, are interstate conflicts, reversing a post–Cold War trend. The United States is uniquely exposed to the growing risk of armed conflict, as no other power has as many allies and security commitments.\nThe second Trump administration has sought to end many ongoing conflicts, such as those in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Gaza Strip, and Ukraine, as well as between India and Pakistan and Cambodia and Thailand. At the same time, however, it has engaged in unnecessarily destabilizing behavior, specifically threatening force and other coercive measures against several countries, including allies, notably in the Western Hemisphere. Regrettably, it has also systematically dismantled the very elements of the U.S. government dedicated to strategic foresight, conflict prevention, and peace-building without replacing them with anything better. Related funding has been slashed in the process. Those actions are both counterproductive and shortsighted.\nU.S. policymakers often find themselves blindsided by conflict-related crises. Those involved frequently lament afterward that officials should have done more to avert or prepare for these crises.\nHopefully, the Trump administration will reverse course in the coming months by no longer alienating important allies and partners, while giving more emphasis to upstream efforts known to promote peace and stability, particularly in areas important to the United States. The findings of this year’s PPS can help in that regard.\nThe PPS asks experts to assess only relatively discrete political and military contingencies—thirty, to be precise—that have been judged during an initial crowdsourcing effort as plausible in the coming twelve months. It is not designed, therefore, to evaluate the risk posed by broad trends such as global warming, demographic change, or technological developments. Those trends, which could easily trigger violent conflict, are simply too difficult to judge over a short time frame. Nor does the PPS attempt to appraise the risk associated with events such as earthquakes, severe weather, public health crises, or the death of a specific leader. Those events can trigger instability, but their likelihood is inherently unpredictable. Respondents are given the opportunity, however, to identify additional conflict-related concerns they believe warrant attention. Those suggestions appear in the list of “Other Noted Concerns.”\nThis year, the survey contained a new feature: respondents were asked to share what they believe are promising opportunities for both averting and managing conflict around the world. The leading results are discussed separately in the “Opportunities for Conflict Prevention and Resolution” section.\nFinally, the results reflect expert opinion at the time the survey was conducted in November 2025. The world is ever-changing, so geopolitical risk assessments need to be regularly updated. CPA does this with its award-winning “\nGlobal Conflict Tracker\n” interactive.\nA man prepares to throw an object as an Israeli tank operates in Jenin, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, on February 23, 2025.\nRaneen Sawafta/Reuters\nMethodology\nThe Center for Preventive Action carried out the 2026 PPS in three stages:\n1. Soliciting PPS Contingencies\nIn October 2025, CPA harnessed various social media platforms to solicit suggestions about possible conflicts to include in the survey. With the help of the Council on Foreign Relations’ in-house regional experts, CPA narrowed down the list of possible conflicts to thirty contingencies deemed both plausible in 2026 and potentially harmful to U.S. interests.\n2. Polling Foreign Policy Experts\nIn November 2025, the survey was sent to approximately 15,000 U.S. government officials, foreign policy experts, and academics, of whom approximately 620 responded. Each was asked to estimate the impact on U.S. interests and likelihood of each contingency according to general guidelines (see risk assessment matrix definitions).\n3. Ranking the Conflicts\nThe survey results were then scored according to their ranking, and the contingencies were subsequently sorted into one of three preventive priority tiers (I, II, and III) according to their placement on the accompanying risk assessment matrix.\nRisk Assessment Matrix and Definitions\nImpact on U.S. Interests\nLikelihood\nHigh\n: contingency directly threatens the U.S. homeland, a defense treaty ally, or a vital strategic interest, and thus is likely to trigger a U.S. military response\nHigh\n: contingency is probable to highly likely to occur in 2026\nModerate\n: contingency indirectly threatens the U.S. homeland and/or affects a country of strategic importance to the United States that is not a defense treaty ally\nModerate\n: contingency has an even chance of occurring in 2026\nLow\n: contingency affects a country of limited strategic importance to the United States but could have severe/widespread humanitarian consequences\nLow\n: contingency is improbable to highly unlikely to occur in 2026\nTier I\nHigh Likelihood; High Impact\nIncreased conflict between Israeli security forces and Palestinians in the\nWest Bank\nover Israeli settlement construction, Palestinian political rights, and the war in Gaza\nRenewed fighting in the\nGaza Strip\n, triggered by increasing clashes between Hamas militants and Israeli security forces, deepens the humanitarian crisis and exacerbates regional instability\nAn intensification of the\nRussia\n-\nUkraine\nwar, caused by expanding attacks on each side’s critical infrastructure and population centers\nU.S. military operations targeting transnational criminal groups escalate to direct strikes in\nVenezuela\n, destabilizing the Maduro government\nGrowing political violence and popular unrest in the\nUnited States\n, exacerbated by heightened political antagonism and domestic security deployments\nModerate Likelihood; High Impact\nRenewed armed conflict between\nIran\nand\nIsrael\n, caused by Iranian efforts to reconstitute its nuclear program and rebuild its regional network of anti-Israel proxy groups\nA state or nonstate entity undertakes a highly disruptive, artificial intelligence–enabled cyberattack on\nU.S. critical infrastructure\nIntensified military, economic, and political pressure by\nChina\non\nTaiwan\nprecipitates a severe cross-strait crisis involving other countries in the region and the United States\nArmed clashes between\nRussia\nand one or more\nNATO\nmember countries, precipitated by increasing Russian provocations toward European states\nA resumption of\nNorth Korean\nnuclear weapons tests heightens tensions on the Korean Peninsula, triggering an armed confrontation involving other regional powers and the United States\nTier II\nHigh Likelihood; Low Impact\nAn escalation of the civil war in\nSudan\nleads to further mass atrocities, civilian displacement, and spillover violence in neighboring countries\nViolent clashes between armed groups and security forces escalate in\nHaiti\n, aggravated by political dysfunction and the failure of international stabilization efforts\nFurther election delays in\nSouth Sudan\ntrigger renewed fighting between armed ethnic and political factions, destabilizing the central government\nVisit the “Global Conflict Tracker” to learn more about ongoing conflicts around the world.\nCivil War in Sudan\nConflict in Yemen\nIndia and Pakistan\nModerate Likelihood; Moderate Impact\nThe withdrawal of U.S. security assistance from\nSomalia\nleads to increased terrorist attacks and expanded territorial control by Al-Shabaab and ISIS\nHouthi attacks on Israel and international shipping provoke retaliatory actions that further degrade state capacity and deepen the humanitarian crisis in\nYemen\nFailed efforts to disarm Hezbollah and continued Israeli military strikes in\nLebanon\ndestabilize the central government and ignite a wider sectarian conflict\nGrowing sectarian violence and a resurgence of ISIS in\nSyria\n, exacerbated by Israeli and Turkish military interventions, weaken the central government and accelerate state fragmentation\nRenewed armed conflict between\nIndia\nand\nPakistan\ndue to heightened terrorist activity and repression in Indian-administered Kashmir\nLow Likelihood; High Impact\nHeightened concerns in the\nUnited States\nover illicit drug production and trafficking by transnational criminal groups lead to direct U.S. military strikes in\nMexico\nAggressive Chinese actions in the\nSouth China Sea\n, especially toward the Philippines, lead to an armed confrontation involving China, the United States, and U.S. allies\nA man adds a tire to a burning barricade during a protest against insecurity in the Pétion-Ville neighborhood of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on April 2, 2025.\nFildor Pq Egeder/Reuters\n",

IBM’s Granite 3.0\nhad only just arrived\n. And the agent conversation was only beginning: MCP had just gained traction in the spring, with a\nnotable endorsement\nfrom Sam Altman.\nMeanwhile, in the world of infrastructure, chips and compute resources were\nbecoming scarce\n, giving new territories a competitive advantage.\nOver the last few weeks,\nIBM Think\nspoke with a dozen experts in tech—researchers, founders and leaders from IBM and beyond—to get their insights on what to expect in the year ahead. Each one shared a common belief for the year ahead: the pace of innovation won’t slow down in 2026.\n“It’s such a crazy time,” Peter Staar, a Principal Research Staff Member at the IBM Research Zurich Laboratory, told\nIBM Think\nin an interview. “And it’s only accelerating.”\nNew agentic capabilities will give way to new possibilities for businesses and individuals alike. “I really see the parallels of music production à la\nRick Rubin\nstyle with AI creation,” IBM’s Distinguished Engineer Chris Hay told\nIBM Think\n. “I don’t limit it to coding. I think we [will] all become AI composers, whether you’re a marketer, programmer or PM.”\nMany believe efficiency will be the new frontier. “GPUs will remain king, but\nASIC-based accelerators\n, chiplet designs, analog inference and even quantum-assisted optimizers will mature,” Kaoutar El Maghraoui, a Principal Research Scientist at IBM, said during this week’s\nMixture of Experts\n. “Maybe a new class of chips for agentic workloads will emerge.”\nAfter much skepticism around AI’s ROI, AI capabilities will pave new ways to do business in the enterprise.

While these aren’t production-scale problems, they’re signals where we expect value to increase as quantum continues maturing. And we are seeing incredible progress in research across drug development, materials discovery and optimization for finance and logistics.”\nGarcia also highlights the convergence with AI: tools like\nQiskit Code Assistant\nare already helping developers generate quantum code automatically. IBM is building a quantum-centric supercomputing architecture that combines quantum computing with powerful high-performance computing and AI infrastructure, supported by CPUs, GPUs and other compute engines, she explained.\nTo push this goal into the future, AMD and IBM are\nexploring how to integrate\nAMD CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs with IBM quantum computers to efficiently accelerate a new class of emerging algorithms, which are outside the current reach of either paradigm working independently.\nRead more on quantum advantage\nHardware efficiency will become the new scaling strategy\n| Kaoutar El Maghraoui, Principal Research Scientist and Manager, AIU Spyre Model Enablement, AI Hardware Center, IBM\n“2026 will be the year of frontier versus efficient model classes,”\nKaoutar El Maghraoui\n, a Principal Research Scientist at IBM, said during a recent episode of\nMixture of Experts\n. Next to huge models with billions of parameters, efficient, hardware-aware models running on modest accelerators will appear. “We can’t keep scaling compute, so the industry must scale efficiency instead.”\nIn 2025,\ndemand outran the supply chain\n, forcing companies to optimize around compute availability. That pressure split hardware strategies: scale-up with superchips like H200, B200, GB200—or scale-out with edge optimizations, quantization breakthroughs and small LLMs, she said.\nThis will also mean that\nedge AI\nwill move from hype to reality. And the hardware race won’t only be about\nGPUs\nanymore. “GPUs will remain king, but\nASIC-based accelerators\n, chiplet designs, analog inference and even quantum-assisted optimizers will mature,” El Maghraoui said. “Maybe a new class of chips for agentic workloads will emerge.”\nBeyond models: The rise of AI systems and agents\nSystems, not models, will define AI leadership\n|\nGabe Goodhart, Chief Architect, AI Open Innovation, IBM\nIn 2026, the competition won’t be on the AI models, but on the systems.\n“We’re going to hit a bit of a commodity point,”\nGabe Goodhart\n, Chief Architect, AI Open Innovation at IBM, said in an interview with\nIBM Think\n. “It’s a buyer’s market. You can pick the model that fits your use case just right and be off to the races. The model itself is not going to be the main differentiator.”\nWhat matters now is\norchestration\n: combining models, tools and workflows. “If you go to ChatGPT, you are not talking to an AI model,” he explained. “You are talking to a software system that includes tools for searching the web, doing all sorts of different individual scripted programmatic tasks, and most likely an agentic loop.”\n“In 2026, I think we’ll see more sort of cooperative\nmodel routing\n,” Goodhart said. “You’ll have smaller models that can do lots of things and delegate to the bigger model when needed. Whoever nails that system-level integration will shape the market.”\nGabe Godhart discusses the wins, fails and future of AI code generation\nAgentic parsing will replace monolithic document processing\n|\nBrian Raymond, Founder & CEO, Unstructured\nIn 2026,\ndocument processing\nwill stop being a one‑model job. Instead of forcing a single system to interpret an entire file, synthetic parsing pipelines break documents into their parts (titles, paragraphs, tables, images) and route each to the model that understands it best.\n“This allows us to reduce computational cost while improving fidelity because each element is interpreted by the model class that understands it best,”\nBrian Raymond\n, Founder and CEO of\nUnstructured\n, told\nIBM Think\n. Unstructured transforms\nunstructured data\ninto clean data ready for AI.\n“The result is a flexible reconstruction layer that synthesizes a precise representation of the original source while maintaining strong guarantees about structure, lineage and meaning,” Raymond said. Unstructured recently\nintegrated the object detection capabilities\nof IBM Research’s Docling in order to accomplish this objective, increasing overall accuracy.\nNext comes agentic parsing. Think of it as a team of domain experts—only they’re AI agents—continuously scanning your corpus, building deep semantic profiles and indexing everything across a multidimensional graph. “This provides search that can operate across intent, structure, content and metadata simultaneously and makes previously inaccessible internal knowledge available in real time,” Raymond said.\nTogether, these advances point to self‑aware enterprise data systems, a foundation for faster decisions and smarter workflows in 2026.\nSee how Unstructured and IBM are helping enterprises get their data AI ready\nCross-functional, cross-channel “super agents” will emerge\n|\nChris Hay, Distinguished Engineer, IBM\n“We’ve moved past the era of single-purpose agents,”\nChris Hay\n, Distinguished Engineer at IBM, said during a recent\nMixture of Experts\nepisode. In 2024, agents were small and specialized: the email writer, the research helper. But now, with\nreasoning capabilities\n, agents can plan, call tools and complete complex tasks.\n“We’re seeing the rise of what I call the ‘super agent,’” Hay said.\n“In 2026, I see agent control planes and multi-agent dashboards becoming real. You’ll kick off tasks from one place, and those agents will operate across environments—your browser, your editor, your inbox—without you having to manage a dozen separate tools,” Hay said. Forget the static software in the user experience and user interface. Expect interfaces and apps that can adapt to any scenario, Hay predicts, making every user an AI composer.\n“Whoever owns that front door to the super agent will shape the market.”\nAI agents will shift from personal assistants to AI‑orchestrated teams, as everyday users become the new agent builders\n|\nKevin Chung, Chief Strategy Officer, Writer\n2026 will be defined by three trends that",

        "original_content": "Crypto market structure and implementation of the Genius Act will dominate US policy discussion in 2026.\nA tax bill is also in the works.\nBut both might hinge on midterm elections in November, which could change the balance of power in Washington, DC.\nThis past year saw a US crypto policy revolution.\nLess than a year into his second term, President Donald Trump has installed industry-friendly regulators who dropped investigations into crypto companies, made it easier for banks to hold crypto and for asset managers to issue crypto-focused exchange-traded funds.\nAt Trumpâ€™s urging, lawmakers\npassed\nlandmark stablecoin legislation and made serious progress on market structure legislation.\nWith these victories in the rearview mirror, itâ€™s fair to wonder whether 2026 will be an eventful year in crypto policy.\nThe short answer: yes.\nSo, without further ado, here are some key dates for US crypto policy in 2026.\nJanuary\nJanuary is set to become an action-packed month.\nFor starters, White House crypto adviser David Sacks has said that the Senate is expected to hold hearings about the market structure bill in the first month of the year.\nâ€œWe are closer than ever to passing the landmark crypto market structure legislation that President Trump has called for,â€� Sacks\nwrote\non X in December. â€œWe look forward to finishing the job in January!â€�\nWe had a great call today with Chairmen\n@SenatorTimScott\nand\n@JohnBoozman\nwho confirmed that a markup for Clarity is coming in January. Thanks to their leadership, as well as\n@RepFrenchHill\nand\n@CongressmanGT\nin the House, we are closer than ever to passing the landmark cryptoâ€¦\n— David Sacks (@davidsacks47)\nDecember 18, 2025\nWe had a great call today with Chairmen\n@SenatorTimScott\nand\n@JohnBoozman\nwho confirmed that a markup for Clarity is coming in January. Thanks to their leadership, as well as\n@RepFrenchHill\nand\n@CongressmanGT\nin the House, we are closer than ever to passing the landmark cryptoâ€¦\n— David Sacks (@davidsacks47)\nDecember 18, 2025\nThose hearings are expected to unclog the bill in the Senate, where it has stalled since a version called the Clarity Act cleared the House of Representatives in July.\nOnce\nexpected\nto pass in 2025, market structure legislation could transform the US crypto industry.\nIt would end a regulatory turf war between the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\nBoth agencies attempted to claim jurisdiction over crypto markets during the Biden administration.\nâ€œIf market structure legislation is enacted in early 2026, the focus will shift to implementation,â€� Blockchain Association CEO Summer Mersinger told\nDL News\n.\nâ€œWe want to ensure we have clear, workable rules from the SEC and CFTC, continued interagency coordination, and targeted fixes like tax clarity, to ensure the United States remains a thriving capital for crypto innovation.â€�\nThat isnâ€™t the only development expected in January.\nSEC Chair Paul Atkins wants to\ncreate\nan â€œinnovation exemptionâ€� to let entrepreneurs â€œimmediately enter the market with new technologies and business modelsâ€� without having to comply with â€œincompatible or burdensomeâ€� regulations, so long as they meet certain conditions.\nOn December 2, Atkins\nsaid\nto expect this innovation exemption within a month. That means it could come any day.\nMay 15\nJerome Powellâ€™s term as chair of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors ends on May 15. Trump has attacked Powell over his refusal to cut interest rates more aggressively.\nThe president will likely name a more pliable successor.\nThe central bank sets US monetary policy. High interest rates make it more expensive to borrow, which puts a damper on high-risk assets, such as cryptocurrency.\nA more dovish approach to monetary policy could fuel a crypto rally â€” but it could also rekindle inflation, one of the issues that fuelled Trumpâ€™s return to the White House.\nWith â€œaffordabilityâ€� the new buzzword in American politics, Trumpâ€™s pick for Fed chair wonâ€™t just impact crypto prices in 2026, but it could also impact the race for the presidency in 2028.\nLong-time Trump ally Kevin Hassett is currently\nseen\nas the frontrunner to be tapped for the job, with Polymarket bettors\ngiving\nhim a 47% chance of being nominated.\nJuly 1\nNew crypto regulations take effect in California on July 1, 2026.\nThe stateâ€™s Digital Financial Assets Law\nrequires\nanyone that engages in â€œdigital financial asset business activityâ€� with a California resident to obtain a license from the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, with certain exemptions.\nThe state is home to many crypto entrepreneurs, and what happens in California has an outsize impact on US tech writ large.\nJuly 18\nPassing a bill gets all the headlines, but the real battle begins when regulators tasked with enacting laws begin to parse the new legislation.\nThe Genius Act directs federal and state regulators to issue additional regulations concerning issuer licensing, capital requirements, custody standards, anti-money laundering provisions, and much, much more.\nThose additional regulations are due on July 18, 2026.\nâ€œThere will be meaningful opportunities for market participants to participate in advocacy efforts and the rulemaking process,â€� lawyers for Gibson Dunn\nwrote\nin July.\nThe process has already become contentious. Banks are demanding that regulators close a â€œloopholeâ€� that allows stablecoin issuers to offer yield, a feature the banks fear will undermine their deposit base. The crypto industry is fighting back.\nThese proposals risk undermining â€œa carefully negotiated compromise, reduce consumer choice, suppress competition, and inject uncertainty into the implementation of a new law,â€� the Blockchain Association said in a\nletter\naddressed to Senators last week.\nAugust\nThere are two developments we can expect by the end of August: the filing of crypto tax legislation and the finalisation of CFTC regulations concerning the use of blockchain technology in capital markets.\nâ€œBeyond market structure, crypto tax policy remains a top priority,â€� Mersinger said, highlighting Representative Mike Careyâ€™s\nrecent work\nwith the Treasury Department to fix tax issues related to crypto staking.\nOn December 20, Representative Max Miller, a Republican from Ohio, filed a\ndraft bill\ncalled the Parity Act. It seeks to establish a de minimus exemption for stablecoins.\nWhat that does is that spending $5 on a latte, for example, doesnâ€™t trigger a taxable event. It also seeks to prevent crypto lending from being treated as taxable selling. And plenty more.\nDuring an appearance at the Blockchain Associationâ€™s December policy summit, Miller\nsaid\nhe believes Congress can pass a version of his bill â€œby hopefully next August.â€�\nIn August 2025, then-CFTC Chair Caroline Pham\nannounced\na 12-month â€œcrypto sprintâ€� focused on spot crypto trading, allowing the use of tokenised collateral in derivatives markets, and tweaking regulations to enable the use of blockchain technology in US markets.\nPham has already\nmade progress\non the first two items, and she envisioned that final item being completed by August 2026.\nNovember 3\nThe US will hold midterm elections on November 3, and they have the potential to flip the outlook for US crypto policy.\nThe president is powerful, but heâ€™s no king â€” the industryâ€™s victories in 2025 have largely come down to the fact that Republicans have narrowly controlled both houses of Congress.\nShould that change in 2026, it could put an end to cryptoâ€™s golden age in Washington, DC.\nDemocrats have certainly warmed to crypto. Market structure legislation in the House passed with more Democrat votes in 2025 than it did in 2024, a shift that warmed the hearts of many a crypto lobbyist earlier this year.\nBut a majority of Democrats are still wary of the libertarian-leaning industry.\nIf Democrats take control of one or both houses of Congress, the odds of passing any crypto legislation will drop significantly.\nFireblocks Policy Director Sea Markova recently\nsaid\nmarket structure legislation was â€œat risk altogether if its passing cuts too close to the midterm elections.â€�\nAleks Gilbert is DL Newsâ€™ New York-based DeFi correspondent.
