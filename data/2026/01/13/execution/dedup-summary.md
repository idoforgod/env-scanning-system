| **Entity Coverage** | PASS | 23 indexed entities available for analysis |
| **Dedup Index Quality** | HIGH | Comprehensive multi-dimensional index |

## Output Files Generated

1. **Filtered Signals**: `/data/2026/01/13/filtered/filtered-signals-2026-01-13.json`
   - Contains 24 new signals with full metadata
   - Ready for next processing stage (structuring/classification)

2. **Deduplication Log**: `/data/2026/01/13/logs/dedup-log-2026-01-13.txt`
   - Detailed removal justifications
   - Timestamped execution record

## Recommendations

1. All 24 new signals are ready for downstream processing
2. No signals require manual review for duplicate detection
3. Dedup-index is comprehensive and effective
4. Continue with standard processing pipeline

**Next Step:** Run classifier/structurer on filtered signals
