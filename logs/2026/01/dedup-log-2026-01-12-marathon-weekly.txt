RECOMMENDATIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. DATABASE INTEGRATION
   - 68 new signals ready for immediate database integration
   - Recommended action: Update signals database with all 68 new entries
   - Estimated DB size after integration: 48 + 68 = 116 signals

2. UPDATE PROCESSING
   - 4 signals identified as updates to existing entries
   - Recommended action: Tag these as "development" updates to existing signals
   - These provide additional context/metrics on known signals

3. QUALITY ASSURANCE
   - 2 signals flagged for entity overlap reviewed and KEPT (valid additions)
   - No concerning duplicates missed in manual review
   - Recommend: Proceed with all outputs

4. DEDUP INDEX MAINTENANCE
   - Update dedup-index with new 68 signal URLs and titles
   - Add 68 new entities to entity_overlap tracking
   - Schedule next dedup run: 2026-01-13 (daily cadence)

5. SOURCE DISCOVERY (Stage 2)
   - 15 new sources discovered in Marathon Mode stage 2
   - Key additions:
     * Georgia Tech, CMU, Princeton, Yale, Oxford, HKU (academic)
     * American Enterprise Institute, Heritage Foundation (policy)
     * Springtide Research Institute, Purpose Economy Institute (research)
     * Daily Sabah, Punch Newspapers (regional)
     * Axios (trend forecasting)
   - Recommended action: Evaluate for permanent addition to source list

6. CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT
   - Overall deduplication confidence: VERY HIGH
   - Recommend immediate processing with no additional human review required
   - All removals well-justified and documented
