Entity Overlap:         Not applied (insufficient implementation)

Overall Deduplication Confidence: 95%

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================
1. Monitor Tracked Topics:
   - DeepSeek R1 continues to appear in multiple forms - recommend unified signal
   - Boston Dynamics Atlas deployment widely covered - consolidate into one evolving signal
   - Humanoid robotics surge at CES 2026 - update main signal with new company data

2. Signals Requiring Human Review:
   - Labor market automation: 11.7% jobs figure widely cited (verify single authoritative source)
   - Chip shortage themes: Multiple angles (pricing, production, design) - may warrant separate signals

3. Emerging Patterns in New Signals:
   - Strong alignment on AI agentic systems (Vera Rubin, DeepSeek, commerce)
   - Physical AI consensus across multiple vendors (robotics converging on market)
   - Spiritual/wellness trends gaining academic credibility
   - US-China tech decoupling paradoxically thawing on standard trade items

4. Data Quality Notes:
   - Some raw signals lack proper structure (missing date, incomplete URL)
   - Source authority varies (recommend tier-based weighting in future dedup)
   - Timing: Several signals from late 2025 appearing in 2026 scans (watch for publication lag)
